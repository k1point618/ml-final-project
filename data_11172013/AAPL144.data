Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Scores Patent Win Against Apple Inc.-Reuters

Wednesday, 30 Nov 2011 01:13am EST

Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is set to resume selling its Galaxy tablet computer in Australia as early as Friday, after the firm won a rare legal victory in a long-running global patent war with Apple Inc. An Australian federal court unanimously decided to lift a preliminary injunction, imposed by a lower court, on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, but granted Apple a stay on lifting the sales ban until Friday afternoon.Â
