Apple Inc. In Talks On iTV With Canada Telecoms-Reuters

Tuesday, 7 Feb 2012 12:36pm EST

Reuters reported that Apple Inc. is in talks with Canada's two telecom companies about becoming partners in the launch of iTV, a device combining features of the wildly popular iPad tablet with those of a television set. Rogers Communications and BCE, parent of Bell Canada, are already testing the device in their labs, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source. Apple has neither confirmed nor denied speculation that it was working on iTV, which the industry believes would involve a new device enabling a user to buy and view licensed content, along the lines of the iTunes model.Â
