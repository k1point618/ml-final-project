Judge Rejects Apple Injunction Bid Versus Samsung Electronics Co Ltd-Reuters

Tuesday, 18 Dec 2012 12:10am EST

Reuters reported that a U.S. judge on Monday denied Apple Inc's request for a permanent injunction against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's smartphones, depriving the iPhone maker of key leverage in the mobile patent wars. Apple had been awarded $1.05 billion in damages in August after a U.S. jury found Samsung had copied critical features of the iPhone and iPad. The Samsung products run on the Android operating system, developed by Google. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute that mirrors the struggle for industry supremacy between the two companies, which control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. For most of the year, Apple had been successful in its U.S. litigation campaign against Samsung. Apple convinced U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California to impose two pretrial sales bans against Samsung, one against the Galaxy Tab 10.1, and the other against the Galaxy Nexus phone. Apple then sought to keep up the pressure after its sweeping jury win. It asked Koh to impose a permanent sales ban against 26 mostly older Samsung phones, though any injunction could potentially have been extended to Samsung's newer Galaxy products.Â
