Google Inc's Motorola Mobility Withdraws Patent Claim Against Apple Inc.-DJ

Tuesday, 2 Oct 2012 03:47pm EDT

Dow Jones reported that Google Inc's Motorola Mobility has withdrawn a patent-infringement claim against rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) that was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission in a bid to ban the import of some Apple products. In its filing published by the ITC, Motorola didn't offer details as to why it is terminating its claim. Motorola's claim, filed in August, alleged that Apple had infringed seven of its patents with Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad. However, the claim didn't concern so-called standards essential patents, which are considered key for the wireless industry and therefore have been a source of considerable friction between its various players. Motorola has filed a separate patent claim against Apple with the ITC, which is ongoing.Â
