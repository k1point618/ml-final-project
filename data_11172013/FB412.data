Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP announced that it has filed a class action suit against Facebook, Inc certain Company executives and/or directors, including Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and certain underwriters. The Complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and is brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased shares of Facebook's Class A common stock issued in connection with Facebook's May 18, 2012 initial public offering through May 21, 2012. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A copy of the Complaint may be obtained from Kaplan Fox or the Court. The Complaint alleges that statements in Facebook's Registration Statement and Prospectus that use of Facebook through the Company's mobile products as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect the Company's revenue and financial results were untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading because, at the time of the IPO, users' access of Facebook through mobile products had already materially negatively affected Facebook's revenue and earnings and caused Facebook to materially reduce its revenue and earnings estimates for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 and for full years 2012 and 2013.Â
