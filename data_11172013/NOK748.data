Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia Oyj and Siemens AG, announced that the company and CDNetworks have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on a set of common objectives around Liquid Applications and operator Content Delivery Networks (CDN). The intent of the collaboration is to further enhance Liquid Applications for content acceleration and content personalization, making use of such capabilities as location and referral, as well as awareness of user behavior and real-time network conditions. Nokia Siemens Networks and CDNetworks will together create a set of new technologies that fully deploy these capabilities to drive a step change in the mobile broadband experience and open up new revenue opportunities for operators. Mobile broadband customers will benefit from faster loading times and improved latency that contribute to a more responsive service experience.Â
