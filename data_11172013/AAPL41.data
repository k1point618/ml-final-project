HTC Corp Shares Jump After Settles Patent Issues With Apple Inc-Reuters

Sunday, 11 Nov 2012 09:13pm EST

Reuters reported that shares of HTC Corp jumped by their permitted daily limit on November 12, 2012 after the Taiwanese smartphone maker announced a global patent settlement and 10-year licensing agreement with Apple Inc, allowing the struggling company to focus on product development. HTC Corp and Apple Inc's settlement and licensing agreement on November 09, 2012 ended one of the first major conflagrations of the smartphone patent wars. The two companies did not disclose details of the settlement or the licensing agreement, but HTC Corp said the agreement will not impact its financials and it will not change its fourth-quarter guidance.Â
