International Business Machines Corp And ZSE Creates Virtual Green Highway For Electric Vehicles

Monday, 9 Apr 2012 12:01am EDT

International Business Machines Corp announced it has teamed with Zapadoslovenska energetika, a. s. (ZSE), distributor and supplier of electricity in Slovakia, on a smart energy 'feasibility' study that will help prepare the capital city Bratislava for electric vehicles (EVs). Using e-mobility technology, the study will help identify the possibilities of connecting two neighboring metropolitan areas – Bratislava, Slovakia and Vienna, Austria with a 'green' highway. This highway will interconnect the two cities with a network of public charging stations for electric vehicles. This study is part of a larger pilot project - VIBRATe' (VIenna BRATislava E-mobility), a first of its kind in Central Europe, with a goal to reduce emissions with a smarter, energy efficient transportation system. Currently, the average combustion engine produces about 45 kg of CO2 per year during the route from Vienna to Bratislava.
