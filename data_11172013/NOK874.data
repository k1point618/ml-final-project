Izard Nobel LLP Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Nokia Oyj

Wednesday, 9 May 2012 03:08pm EDT

Izard Nobel LLP, which has experience representing investors in prosecuting claims of securities fraud, announced that a lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of the publicly traded securities of Nokia Oyj (Nokia or the Company) between October 26, 2011 and April 10, 2012, inclusive (the Class Period). The Complaint alleges that Nokia, a provider of telecommunications infrastructure hardware, software, and services worldwide, and certain of its officers and directors violated the federal securities laws. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants told investors that Nokia's conversion to a Windows platform would halt its deteriorating position in the smartphone market. It did not. This became apparent on April 11, 2012, when Nokia disclosed that its first quarter performance would be worse than expected. Nokia expected its first quarter 2012 non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin to fall by 3%, and projected first quarter 2012 Devices & Services net sales of EUR 4.2 billion. It also disclosed a glitch in its newest Windows offering -- the Lumia 900. Nokia had to immediately offer customers an automatic $100, making the phone essentially free. On this news, the price of Nokia's American Depositary Shares (ADRs) dropped over 16% in a single day.Â
