Daimler AG And Google Deepen Strategic Partnership

Wednesday, 11 Jan 2012 01:04pm EST

Daimler AG and Google announced a deepening of their strategic partnership to provide Daimler with access to the suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) known as Google Maps API for Business for the use of cloud-based, map-related applications in Daimler vehicles and early access to other new APIs as they are developed. These applications significantly accelerate time-to-market in Mercedes-Benz passenger cars. The collaboration will enable Daimler to use Google Maps for their in-car map displays, and significantly improve their ability to quickly and seamlessly integrate useful Google services into Mercedes-Benz passenger vehicles. By making innovative Google products available directly within its cars, Mercedes-Benz is able to accelerate the adoption of cutting edge technologies.Â
