Nokia Oyj Wins German Patent Ruling Against HTC Corp-Reuters

Tuesday, 19 Mar 2013 01:36pm EDT

Reuters reported that a German court ruled in favor of Nokia Oyj, saying some devices made by Taiwan's HTC Corp infringed on its power-saving patent. The case was one of 22 infringement suits Nokia has brought against HTC in Germany. Nokia is pleased with this decision. The power-saving patent refers to a technology for saving battery power while connected to a network. HTC said its business in Germany would not be affected by the Mannheim regional court's ruling as it covers only three handsets it no longer imports into the country. It said it would appeal the decision while also continuing efforts to have the patent declared invalid by the German Federal Patents Court and the English Patents Court. Nokia said it has also asserted the power-saving patent against HTC in the United Kingdom and at the United States International Trade Commission, with a hearing in the United States to start in two months.Â
