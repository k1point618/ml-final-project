Monday, 16 Apr 2012 11:56pm EDT

Reuters reported that a unit of Toshiba Corporation is in talks to buy International Business Machines Corp's point-of-sale (POS) terminal business, which includes cash registers. The purchase, which local media put at around $870 million, was aimed at expanding the global reach of Toshiba's half-owned Toshiba Tec Corp. Toshiba Tec would pay JPY70 billion ($870 million) for the IBM business, which counts Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us as customers, mainly financing the deal with cash reserves and bank loans, the Nikkei business daily reported.Â
