Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Chiefs Disagree On Patent Values- Reuters

Tuesday, 24 Jul 2012 02:02am EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook and top Samsung Electronic Co Ltd executives disagreed previous week on the value of each other's patents at a settlement conference ahead of a high profile U.S. trial, according to a source familiar with the matter. Apple and Samsung, the consumer electronics corporations, are waging legal war in several countries, accusing each other of patent violations as they vie for supremacy in the fast-growing market for mobile devices. The trial is scheduled to begin July 30 in a San Jose, Calif. federal court. Cook participated in mediation with Samsung's Vice Chairman Choi Gee-sung and mobile chief Shin Jong-Kyun earlier in the San Francisco area to see if the two sides could resolve the dispute, several separate sources said. The executives from Apple and Samsung participated as part of the court directed mediation process, these sources said. While a settlement is always possible, it is unlikely to come ahead of the California trial, they said. Among the major issues in dispute between Apple and Samsung is how to value so-called standard essential patents. These are patents which Samsung agreed to license to competitors on fair and reasonable terms, in exchange for having the technology be adopted as an industry standard. Some judges are reluctant to issue injunctions over such patents. Apple believes those patents should be valued lower due to those dynamics, one of the sources said.Â
