EU Data Chiefs Ask Google Inc To Change Privacy Policy-Reuters

Monday, 15 Oct 2012 10:00pm EDT

Reuters reported that European Union (EU) regulators want Google Inc to make changes to its new privacy policy to protect the rights of its users, the EU's national data protection re g ulators said in a letter to the U.S. internet company, which was seen by Reuters. The letter, which stopped short of declaring Google's approach to collecting user data illegal, follows a n investigation led by France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique (CNIL) that began in February. Leading the inquiry on behalf of Europe, France's data protection watchdog had already questioned the legality and fairness of Google's new privacy policy, introduced in March. This consolidated 60 privacy policies into one and pooled data collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, Gmail and its social network Google+. Users cannot opt out.Â
