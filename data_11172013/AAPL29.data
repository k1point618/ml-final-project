US ITC To Review Apple Inc Patent Complaint Against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd-Reuters

Wednesday, 23 Jan 2013 06:43pm EST

Reuters reported that a U.S. trade panel that specializes in patent disputes will review a potentially key decision in the patent fight between Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc over smartphones and tablets. The panel, the International Trade Commission, also sent part of the dispute back to judge, who ruled in October that Samsung infringed four Apple patents but did not violate two others. The full commission said on Wednesday it would review the judge's decision, and asked the agency judge to take a second look at portions of two patents where he had found that Samsung infringed. One of the patents in question allows the use of a headset with the smartphone while the other allows the device to show an image on a screen with a second, translucent image over it. Apple had filed a complaint in mid-2011, accusing Samsung of infringing its patents in making its Captivate, Transform and Fascinate smartphones, as well as the Galaxy Tablet.Â
