Apple Inc., Sony, Four Others Sued By Graphics Properties Holdings Inc-Reuters

Tuesday, 27 Mar 2012 02:31pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc., Sony Corporation and four other companies were sued by Graphics Properties Holdings Inc, formerly known as Silicon Graphics Inc, for allegedly infringing a patent through their sale of mobile phones and other electronic devices. The lawsuits against Apple Inc., Sony, HTC Corporation, LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, and Research In Motion Limited were filed in the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The patent at issue relates to a computer graphics process that turns text and images into pixels to be displayed on screens. According to the lawsuits, the defendants' infringing devices include Apple's iPhone and the HTC EVO4G, LG Thrill, Research in Motion Torch, Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, and Sony Xperia Play smartphones. Graphics Properties said that unless the alleged infringements are halted, it will suffer irreparable harm. The lawsuits seek to stop the sale of infringing products and also seek reasonable royalties and other damages. Apple and Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Silicon Graphics filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and sold much of its operations to Rackable Systems Inc. The remaining operations are based in New Rochelle, New York, and are owned by private investment firms and other investors, according to the complaints.Â
