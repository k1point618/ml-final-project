Dow Jones reported that An Australian federal court judge ordered Apple Inc to pay a AUD2.25 million (USD2.29 million) fine for potentially misleading consumers over the capabilities of its new iPad tablet. Judge Mordecai Bromberg ruled in a Melbourne court that the technology giant's branding of its newest version of the iPad implied it could connect with fourth generation cellular networks in Australia, when it couldn't, which effectively was liable to mislead the public and breached consumer law.Â
