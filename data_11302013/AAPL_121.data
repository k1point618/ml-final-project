U.S. Sues Apple Inc., Publishers In e-book Price Scheme-Reuters
Wednesday, 11 Apr 2012 07:10pm EDT
Reuters reported that the U.S. government sued Apple Inc. and five publishers, saying they conspired to fix the prices of electronic books, and reached a settlement with three of the publishers that could lead to cheaper e-books for consumers. The Justice Department accused Apple of colluding with the five publishers as the Silicon Valley giant was launching its iPad in early 2010 and was seeking to break up Amazon.com's low-cost dominance in the digital book market. Because of the agreement, e-book prices went up an average of $2 to $3 in a three-day period in early 2010. The settlement reached with three of the publishers will allow Amazon.com to resume discounting books, and will terminate the most favored nation contracts with Apple. The pact also requires the publishers to wait two years before entering into any agency model agreements that prevent retailers from offering discounts on electronic books. The publishers who agreed to settle are The News Corporation's HarperCollins Publishers Inc, CBS Corporation's Simon & Schuster Inc and Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group. Hachette and HarperCollins also settled with a group of U.S. states, agreeing to pay $51 million in restitution to consumers who bought e-books. Publishers Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH, and Pearson PLC Penguin Group, plan to fight the Justice Department charges, along with Apple.Â
