Nokia Oyj Announces Mapping Deal with Oracle Corp
Monday, 1 Oct 2012 09:01am EDT
Nokia Oyj announced that Oracle Corp has developed a simple, built-in link between Oracle Fusion Middleware MapViewer and the Nokia Location Platform (NLP). This link removes the barrier of a customized map integration and extends the benefits of global maps for business use to Oracle users. NLP provides maps for almost 200 countries. By integrating NLP with Oracle applications, maps and business data can align to one consistent, accurate map on a worldwide basis. Oracle users will have opportunity to license NLP from Nokia for use in Oracle applications. Oracle Fusion Middleware MapViewer is a J2EE service for rendering maps and creating mashups using spatial data. Oracle Fusion Middleware MapViewer provides services and tools that hide the complexity of spatial data queries and cartographic rendering, while providing customizable options for more advanced users such as developers of geographic business analytic applications. The integration of NLP allows users to easily include Nokia's map data into their Oracle business applications.Â
