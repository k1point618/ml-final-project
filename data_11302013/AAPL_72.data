Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd expert witness testified that Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad violate three of Samsung's patents, as the South Korean electronics company went on offense in the third week of a high stakes trial. Dr. Woodward Yang, an electrical engineering professor at Harvard, said Apple's products use Samsung-patented features for mobile devices, including the process for seamlessly emailing photos. He was one of Samsung's first witnesses after a parade of Apple experts said Samsung phones and tablets violated Apple's patents. Additionally, one of Samsung's designers testified that she did not rely on Apple designs to create icons for Samsung's Galaxy S smartphone line. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute mirroring a struggle for industry supremacy between two rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. The U.S. company accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages. The Korean company, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology. Yang focused on patents that cover smartphone features, not wireless technology. One of those patents covers technology for easily finding photos in an album. Under questioning from Apple attorney Bill Lee, Yang acknowledged he had not seen evidence that Samsung actually used any of those features in its own smartphones.Â
