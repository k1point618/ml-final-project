Eastman Kodak Company Loses Preliminary Patent ITC Ruling Against Apple Inc And Research in Motion Ltd-Reuters
Monday, 21 May 2012 03:56pm EDT
Reuters reported that Eastman Kodak Company lost a preliminary patent ruling on Monday, as a trade panel judge ruled that Apple Inc and Research in Motion Ltd did not violate a Eastman Kodak Company patent because it was invalid. An administrative law judge at the International Trade Commission said that the critical portion of Eastman Kodak Company's patent, which allows a user to preview digital images, was invalid because it was obvious. The full ITC will confirm or overturn the judge's decision in September. This is the second round through the ITC for this dispute an ITC judge had previously found the same patent invalid but the full ITC asked for that decision to be reviewed. Although ITC Judge Thomas Pender again found the patent invalid, he also found that the Apple iPhone 3G and some RIM mobile phones used the technology. Eastman Kodak Company said it was confident that it would win in the end since the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had reviewed the patent in question and found it valid. Eastman Kodak Company said it would appeal the finding of invalidity.Â
