Yahoo! Inc. And Alibaba Group Holding Limited Reach Agreement On Comprehensive Plan For Alibaba Stake; Yahoo! Board Increases Share Repurchase Plan By $5 Billion
Sunday, 20 May 2012 09:37pm EDT
Yahoo! Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Limited announced they have entered into definitive agreement for a staged and comprehensive value realization plan for Yahoo!’s stake in Alibaba. The first step is the repurchase by Alibaba of up to one-half of Yahoo!’s stake, or approximately 20% of Alibaba’s fully-diluted shares. The purchase price will be based on a valuation of Alibaba to be established through equity financings that Alibaba intends to undertake to finance the transaction, subject to a floor valuation of approximately $35 billion. At the minimum price and assuming the initial repurchase of the full 20% stake, Yahoo! would receive from Alibaba consideration of approximately $7.1 billion, composed of at least $6.3 billion in cash proceeds and up to $800 million in newly-issued Alibaba preferred stock. The companies have also agreed to amend their existing technology and intellectual property licensing agreement. This amendment will result in Yahoo! granting Alibaba transitional license to continue to operate Yahoo! China under Yahoo! brand for up to four years, while restrictions on Yahoo!’s ability to make other investments in China will be terminated. Alibaba will make an upfront lump sum royalty payment of $550 million to Yahoo! and continuing royalty payments for up to four years. Alibaba will license certain patents to Yahoo!. Yahoo!'s board has increased Yahoo!'s share buyback authorization by $5 billion concurrently with this transaction.
