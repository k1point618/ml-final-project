Renesas Electronics Corp And Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Collaborate To Construct Ecosystem For Microcontrollers
Monday, 28 May 2012 02:30am EDT
Renesas Electronics Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) announced that they have signed an agreement to extend their microcontroller (MCU) technology collaboration to 40 nanometer (nm) embedded flash (eFlash) process technology for manufacturing MCU products used in automotive and consumer applications such as home appliances. Renesas previously agreed to outsource MCUs to TSMC using 90nm eFlash process technology. Under the 40nm MCU collaboration, Renesas will outsource MCU production at 40nm and future technologies. Renesas and TSMC will collaborate to lead in advanced technologies for MCU platform and production by combining Renesas’ MONOS (Metal-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon) technology supporting both high reliability and high speed, and high-quality technical support with TSMC’s advanced CMOS process technologies and flexible production capacity.
