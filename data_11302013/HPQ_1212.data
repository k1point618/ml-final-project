Business Line reported that US-based Hewlett-Packard Co's (HP) India unit has won a stay against Customs Department order asking the computer manufacturer to pay $386 million in alleged duty evasion. The Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) has stayed the Commissioner of Customs Bangalore’s order against HP India Sales Private Ltd (HPI), HP said. The case relates to an investigation by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2008, where the Government agency had alleged that HPI had underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India. In April last year, the Commissioner of Customs Bangalore had issued an order on the products show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HPI and the named individuals of approximately $386 million.
