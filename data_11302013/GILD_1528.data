Gilead Sciences, Inc. Announces U.S. FDA Grants Priority Review For Truvada For Reducing The Risk Of Acquiring HIV Infection
Monday, 13 Feb 2012 07:25pm EST
Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted a six-month Priority Review for once-daily Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults. Truvada was approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and is currently the most-prescribed antiretroviral treatment in the United States. The FDA grants priority review status to drug candidates that provide major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Gilead submitted the Truvada for PrEP sNDA on December 15, 2011. The FDA has set a target review date for Truvada for PrEP under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of June 15, 2012. The agency has also indicated that Truvada for PrEP will be discussed at the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee meeting scheduled in May.Â
