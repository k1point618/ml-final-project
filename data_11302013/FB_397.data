FTC Clears Facebook Inc's Acquisition Of Instagram-Reuters
Wednesday, 22 Aug 2012 08:36pm EDT
Reuters reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cleared Facebook Inc's acquisition of Instagram, voting unanimously to close its antitrust investigation into the deal without taking any action. The move frees Facebook to complete its purchase of the mobile photo application maker, the biggest acquisition in its history. Facebook announced plans to buy Instagram in a cash and stock deal for $1 billion in April. Under the terms of the deal, Facebook will acquire Instagram for $300 million in cash and roughly 23 million shares of Facebook common stock.Â
