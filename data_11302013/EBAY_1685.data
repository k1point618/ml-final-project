eBay Inc To Stop Re-Selling Tickets On UK Website-DJ
Monday, 21 Jan 2013 04:31am EST
Dow Jones reported that eBay Inc will stop selling secondary tickets on its UK website, to encourage customers to use its ticket re-selling site StubHub Inc.'s UK site. Stubhub has done well in the U.S. but has struggled in the UK thus far. Stubhub Inc. re-sells one ticket every second in its core U.S. market, but the UK website - launched last year - sells only a few thousand tickets a month. eBay will start redirecting customers looking for tickets on its UK website to Stubhub's UK site this spring.Â
