Sap AG's Co-CEO Steps Down-DJ
Monday, 22 Jul 2013 06:37am EDT
Dow Jones reported that Sap AG said that Jim Hagemann Snabe, its Co-CEO since 2010, would step down from that role next years. The move will leave the Company's other Co-CEO Bill McDermott as the sole Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Company's CTO Vishal Sikka, who also sits on its board of directors, is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and is considered a candidate to join McDermott as the next co-CEO once Hagemann Snabe's departure is effective. Sikka took over responsibility for all software development work during another shakeup in May.Â
