Apple Inc. Wins Second Injunction Against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Blocking 'Nexus' Phone Sales-DJ
Saturday, 30 Jun 2012 08:11pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd suffered a legal setback at the hands of a California judge, who issued an injunction on Friday against its 'Galaxy Nexus' smartphone at the request of Apple Inc. The preliminary injunction, which bans Samsung from selling or importing the phone into the U.S., marks another win for Apple in a continuing legal battle. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh wrote that Apple had made a strong case that Samsung was infringing its bevy of patents, including technology for searching multiple databases, a function found in Apple's 'Siri' voice-automated assistant program used on the iPhone 4S. Samsung released the Galaxy Nexus in the U.S. in December.Â
