Hewlett Packard Co Launches Multi-Year Restructuring To Fuel Innovation And Enable Investment
Wednesday, 23 May 2012 04:06pm EDT
Hewlett Packard Co outlined plans for a multi-year productivity initiative designed to simplify business processes, advance innovation and deliver better results for customers, employees and shareholders. The restructuring is expected to generate annualized savings in the range of $3.0 to $3.5 billion exiting fiscal year 2014, of which majority will be reinvested back into the Company. As part of the restructuring, it expects approximately 27,000 employees to exit the Company, or 8.0% of its workforce as of October 31, 2011, by end of fiscal year 2014. The Company is offering an early retirement program, so the total number of employees affected will be impacted by the number of employees that participate in early retirement plan. Workforce reduction plans will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultation with works councils and employee representatives, as appropriate. The Company expects to achieve additional savings from non-headcount cost reductions, including supply chain optimization, SKU and platform rationalization, go to market strategy simplification and business process improvement. As a result of this restructuring, it expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2012 that will be included in its GAAP financial results for that period. Through fiscal 2014, it expects to record additional pre-tax charges approximating $1.8 billion that will be included in its GAAP financial results for the appropriate periods.Â
