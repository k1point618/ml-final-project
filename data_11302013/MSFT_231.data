EU Court Only Slightly Reduces Microsoft Corp Fine-DJ
Wednesday, 27 Jun 2012 04:09am EDT
Dow Jones reported that Microsoft Corp suffered a blow in its long running battle with European Union regulators as Europe's second highest court decided to only slightly reduce a 2008 European Commission decision to fine the company. Judges reduced the fine to EUR860 million ($1.07 billion) from EUR899 million, but said they rejected all the arguments proposed by Microsoft. The Company had appealed against a commission ruling that it should open up the software market to rivals. The decision by the General Court of the EU is likely to come as a major relief for the commission as it seeks to pursue companies for failing to carry out its orders in anti-trust cases.Â
