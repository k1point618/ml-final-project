USITC Told To Review Ruling That Google Inc's Motorola Mobility Did Not Violate Microsoft Corp Patent - Reuters
Thursday, 3 Oct 2013 11:42am EDT
Reuters reported that an appeals court on October 03, 2013 partially reversed a ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission, asking it to reconsider a decision that Google Inc subsidiary Motorola Mobility did not infringe on a Microsoft Corp MSFT.O patent. Acting on an appeal by Microsoft, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the ITC was correct in finding that Motorola Mobility, which has since been bought by Google, did not infringe three patents. But it found that the ITC erred in its reasoning in finding that a fourth patent was not infringed upon, and asked the ITC to reconsider that patent, which describes a graphical computer interface. In the original case, the ITC had found that Motorola Mobility did infringe one patent for meeting-scheduling technology.Â
