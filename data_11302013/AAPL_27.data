PCCW Ltd's Unit Seeks To Challenge Apple Inc Phone Locking In Court-DJ
Friday, 22 Feb 2013 03:05am EST
Dow Jones reported that the battle over Apple Inc's locked iPhone sales has now reached Hong Kong's shores after a local telecommunications company filed court documents this week seeking to contest restrictions on locked iPhones. According to court documents filed by a unit of PCCW Ltd, the operator has allegedly lost hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars because Apple's latest iPhone 5 doesn't function on its fourth-generation network. Apple has come under heavy fire for its phone locking policies in the United States, where for years, the iPhones it sold were only configured to operate on the AT&T network. Most iPhones in the U.S. are still sold locked, limiting the ability of consumers to use the device with different carriers, though Apple now sells unlocked iPhones in the U.S. for a premium over those attached with a calling plan. On September 28, shortly after PCCW discovered that the iPhone 5 wasn't functioning on its fourth-generation network, its unit, Hong Kong Telecommunications, filed a complaint with the city's telecommunications regulator. The effort hasn't yielded any success, prompting the operator to turn to the city's legal system, instead. HKT is seeking a judicial review of the way in which the regulator has dealt with the case.Â
