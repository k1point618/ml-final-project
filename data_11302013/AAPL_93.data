U.S. Judge Rejects Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Request To Lift Stay On Nexus Sales-Reuters
Tuesday, 3 Jul 2012 08:53pm EDT
Reuters reported that a U.S. judge on July 3, 2012, rejected a request by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to lift a pre-trial injunction against sales of its Galaxy Nexus phone, another legal setback for the South Korean firm ahead of an upcoming court battle with Apple Inc. Last week, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, granted Apple's request to block sales of the smartphone. Samsung had asked the court to stay the injunction pending resolution of an appeal.Â
