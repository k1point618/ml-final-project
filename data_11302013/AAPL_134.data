Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Files Fresh Lawsuit Against Apple Inc. In South Korea-Reuters
Wednesday, 7 Mar 2012 03:27am EST
Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has filed another lawsuit against Apple Inc. in South Korea, claiming the iPhone 4S and iPad2 infringed on three of its patents. The move escalates the tension between the firms as they vie for dominance of the mobile device market, after a series of legal clashes in Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. Samsung said the fresh suit, filed on Tuesday to a Seoul court, covers three utility patents and involves methods of displaying data, the user interface, and short text messages. The companies have extended their fight to more than 30 cases in 10 countries since Apple fired its first salvo in April, claiming Samsung copied its iPhone and iPad models.Â
