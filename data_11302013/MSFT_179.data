VirnetX Holding Corp announced that on April 22, 2013, it filed a complaint against Microsoft Corp in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. The complaint includes allegations of willful patent infringement regarding six patents owned by VirnetX, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,502,135, 7,188,180, 7,418,504, 7,490,151, 7,921,211, and 7,987,274. Specifically, the complaint references Microsoft's Skype products as infringing the VirnetX patents. Skype was purchased after the limited license was signed between Microsoft and VirnetX.
