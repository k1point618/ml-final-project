US Court Not To Review Decision in Case Between Nokia Oyj and InterDigital Inc-Reuters
Thursday, 10 Jan 2013 12:33pm EST
Reuters reported that a federal appeals court that had revived an InterDigital Inc patent complaint against Nokia Oyj declined on January 10, 2013 to review that decision, according to a court filing. InterDigital filed a complaint at the International Trade Commission (ITC) in 2007 accusing Nokia of infringement. The ITC found that Nokia was innocent, but the United States (US) Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit revived the complaint and sent it back to the ITC where it is pending. Meanwhile, Nokia urged the appeals court to reconsider its decision by arguing that InterDigital did not manufacture any products using the patents, a requirement for bringing an infringement complaint to the ITC. A divided court declined on January 10, 2013, ruling that licenses that InterDigital has given for the technology fulfills the ITC requirement. The patented technology in the complaint is for wireless phones.Â
