Amgen Inc Announces 31% Increase In 2013 First Quarter Dividend And Increase In Share Repurchase Authorization
Thursday, 13 Dec 2012 05:09pm EST
Amgen Inc announced that Board of Directors declared a $0.47 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2013. The dividend will be paid on March 7, 2013, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on Feb. 13, 2013. This represents an approximate 31 % increase from that paid in each of the previous four quarters. Amgen's Board of Directors also approved an increase in share repurchase authorization in the amount of $2 billion. This amount is in addition to approximately $0.5 billion remaining under the previously announced $10 billion share repurchase program. Amgen expects that the increase in repurchase authorization being announced today will cover the company's share repurchase activity into 2014. The company expects to fund these additional share repurchases and the dividend with U.S. cash on hand and U.S. free cash flow.Â
