Starbucks Corp Loses Charbucks Appeal - Reuters
Friday, 15 Nov 2013 12:43pm EST
Reuters reported that Starbucks Corp has failed to persuade a federal appeals court to stop a small, family-owned New Hampshire roaster from selling coffee known as Charbucks. Ruling in a case that began in 2001, the second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Black Bear Micro Roastery and its owner, Wolfe's Borough Coffee Inc., may keep selling Charbucks Blend, Mister Charbucks and Mr. Charbucks coffee. Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier wrote for a three-judge panel that Seattle-based Starbucks did not deserve an injunction to stop Charbucks sales, having failed to prove that consumers would be confused through a blurring of its brand. The New York-based appeals court let stand a December 2011 finding by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan that Charbucks was only weakly associated with the minimally similar Starbucks trademark.Â
