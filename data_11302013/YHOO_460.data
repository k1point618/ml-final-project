Yahoo! Inc. CEO Search Down To Levinsohn, Kilar-Reuters
Thursday, 5 Jul 2012 06:19pm EDT
Reuters reported that the race to become Yahoo! Inc.'s next Chief Executive (CEO) appears to have come down to two candidates, current interim CEO Ross Levinsohn and Hulu CEO Jason Kilar. According to two sources with knowledge of the situation, Levinsohn and Kilar are the last names left on the Yahoo board's shortlist for permanent CEO of the Company. Yahoo's board also had on its shortlist Jonathan Miller and wanted to speak with him about the position, but Miller declined to pursue discussions. According to this source, Miller put the brakes on any talks with Yahoo's Board out of respect for his friendship with Levinsohn, who has long wanted to run a company as CEO. Prior to their current positions, Miller and Levinsohn ran an investment firm together named Fuse Capital. Kilar, however, has no such personal relationship with Levinsohn, which is why he is still on the shortlist.Â
