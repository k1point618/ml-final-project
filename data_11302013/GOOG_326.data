Oracle Corp-Google Inc Judge Ends Probe Into Paid Bloggers-Reuters
Thursday, 6 Sep 2012 09:16am EDT
Reuters reported that the federal judge overseeing a major lawsuit over smartphone technology between Oracle Corp and Google Inc has quietly ended his examination of those companies' relationships with paid bloggers and other commentators. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco had shocked the legal and blogging communities on August 7 by demanding names of 'print or Internet authors, journalists, commentators or bloggers' on the companies' payrolls. The judge at the time expressed concern that payments might have influenced writings about the case. Legal experts questioned the breadth of the order, including whether it could violate the writers' First Amendment free speech rights.Â
