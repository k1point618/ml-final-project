Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Expert Says Apple Inc Overstates Damages At Trial- Reuters
Thursday, 16 Aug 2012 08:30pm EDT
Reuters Reported that a Samsung Electronics Co Ltd financial expert claimed that Apple Inc has overstated Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's profit margins for mobile products, an issue that goes to the heart of damages in the high profile patent trial between the two tech companies. Michael Wagner, an accountant who testified on August 16, for Samsung, said Samsung's U.S. profits from the smartphones and tablets targeted in the case should be calculated at about 12%, or about $519 million. Earlier in the trial, an Apple expert witness testified the U.S. margin was closer to 35.5%. Additionally, two other Samsung financial experts contended that Apple should owe up to $421.8 million for violating a clutch of the South Korean company's patents. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute that mirrors a bigger struggle for industry supremacy between the rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages. South Korea's Samsung, which is trying to expand in the United States, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology. Earlier, Apple expert Terry Musika said Samsung earned 35.5% margins from mid-2010 through March 2012, on $8.16 billion in U.S. revenue. Apple is seeking over $2.5 billion in damages.Â
