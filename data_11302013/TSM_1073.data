Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd And Imagination Technologies Group PLC Announces Technology Collaboration
Monday, 25 Mar 2013 03:00am EDT
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and Imagination Technologies Group PLC announced the next phase of their technology collaboration. As part of this new phase of their relationship, Imagination will work closely with TSMC to develop highly optimised reference design flows and silicon implementations using Imagination's PowerVR Series6 GPUs combined with TSMC's advanced process technologies, including 16-nanometer (nm) FinFET process technology. Imagination and TSMC R&D teams will also work together to create fully characterised reference system designs, utilizing high bandwidth memory standards and TSMC's 3D IC technology capability to demonstrate new levels of system performance and capabilities while retaining all the essential characteristics of power, silicon area and small package footprint demanded by high volume mobile SoCs.Â
