Google Inc, Apple Inc. CEOs In Secret Patent Talks-Reuters
Thursday, 30 Aug 2012 04:46pm EDT
Reuters reported that Google Inc Chief Executive Larry Page and Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook have been conducting behind-the-scenes talks about a range of intellectual property matters, including the mobile patent disputes between the companies. Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear. The two companies are keeping lines of communication open at a high level against the backdrop of Apple's legal victory in a patent infringement case against Samsung, which uses Google’s Android software.
