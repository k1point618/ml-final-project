Apple Inc. Targets More Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Products In Patent Suit-Reuters
Friday, 31 Aug 2012 09:00pm EDT
Reuters reported that seeking to capitalize on a major legal victory over Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Apple Inc. has asked a federal court in a separate case to find that four additional Samsung products, including the Galaxy S III, infringe Apple's patents. In February, Apple alleged that at least 17 Samsung products infringe its patents. In a court filing made in San Jose federal court on Friday, Apple added four more products to the list of allegedly infringing products that have been released beginning in August 2011 and continuing through this month. Apple won a major victory over Samsung last Friday in a separate case when a jury found that the South Korean company had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded the U.S. company $1.05 billion in damages.Â
