Salesforce.com Inc Announces Pricing of $1 Billion Offering of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018
Tuesday, 12 Mar 2013 11:54pm EDT
Salesforce.com Inc announced the pricing of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2018 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Salesforce.com also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of the notes to cover overallotments. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on March 18, 2013. The notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of salesforce.com, and interest will be payable semi-annually at a rate of 0.25% per year. The initial conversion rate is 3.7628 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $265.76 per share). Prior to January 1, 2018, the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of specified events; thereafter until maturity the notes will be convertible at any time. Salesforce.com expects to use a portion of the net proceeds for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions after such cost is offset by the proceeds of the warrant transactions described above, and to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures.Â
