Standard & Poor's Rating Services Affirms Nokia Oyj's Ratings-Reuters
Tuesday, 29 May 2012 09:06am EDT
Reuters reported that Standard & Poor's Rating Services has affirmed Nokia Oyj's credit ratings at 'BB+' and 'B'. The outlook is negative. The Standard & Poor's announced that the ratings on the Company reflect its opinion of the Company's fair business risk profile and intermediate financial risk profile. The ratings are constrained by the fiercely competitive nature of the mobile handset business that requires rapid technological advances to satisfy fast-changing customer demands; the Company's revenues from Symbian-based smartphones have declined for some time but the decline accelerated in the first quarter of 2012. The ratings are also constrained by Standard & Poor's expectation of negative non-IFRS operating margins for the Devices and Services division and negative consolidated free operating cash flow (FOCF) in 2012 and the low profitability of and challenging competitive conditions facing its 50%-owned but fully consolidated network business, Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN). The ratings are supported by the group's conservative financial policy, which targets a strong balance sheet and a very robust liquidity position. They are also supported by the group's substantial intellectual property rights and the on-going restructuring of the Devices and Services division and NSN, targeting a combined annual cost reduction of at least EUR2 billion by the end of 2013.Â
