Graco Inc Closes Finishing Brands Acquisition Of Illinois Tool Works Inc
Monday, 2 Apr 2012 09:38am EDT
Graco Inc announced that it has closed on its $650 million acquisition of the Illinois Tool Works Inc. finishing businesses. The Company previously announced that it reached an agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which allowed for closing to occur while the FTC investigates and considers a settlement proposal from Graco. The acquisition includes complementary powder and liquid finishing equipment operations, technologies and brands. In powder finishing, Graco has added Gema, the Powder Finishing business, and approximately one-third of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to this business. In industrial liquid finishing, the acquisition includes Binks spray finishing equipment, DeVilbiss spray guns and accessories. As disclosed on March 27, 2012, the FTC has issued an order for Graco to hold the Liquid Finishing assets separate from the Powder Finishing and other Graco businesses while the FTC investigates and considers a settlement proposal from Graco. In compliance with the FTC’s order, the Liquid Finishing businesses have been acquired into a structure that limits commingling of the Liquid Finishing operations with Graco’s other businesses. Although the Liquid Finishing businesses are wholly owned by Graco, they will be run independently by existing management under the supervision of a trustee who reports directly to the FTC.
