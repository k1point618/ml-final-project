Yahoo! Inc. And Facebook Inc Seek More Time For Settlement Talks-Reuters
Wednesday, 20 Jun 2012 04:23pm EDT
Reuters reported that Yahoo! Inc. and Facebook Inc believe settlement talks in a high profile patent lawsuit would be helped if a U.S. judge pushed back certain deadlines in the case, according to a court filing on Tuesday. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming the social networking company infringed 10 of Yahoo's patents, including several that cover online advertising technology. In its lawsuit, Yahoo said Facebook was considered 'one of the worst performing sites for advertising' prior to adapting Yahoo's ideas. Facebook then filed a countersuit of its own and called Yahoo short sighted for its decision to prioritize 'litigation over innovation'. In a court filing on Tuesday, Yahoo attorney Kevin Smith asked a San Francisco federal judge to push back a series of deadlines in the case for two weeks. Facebook did not oppose the request. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White approved the delay request on Wednesday.Â
