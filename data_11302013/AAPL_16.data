Apple Inc To Pay $53 Million In iPhone Warranty Settlement-Reuters
Friday, 12 Apr 2013 08:16am EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc has agreed to pay $53 million to settle a class action lawsuit claiming it failed to honor warranties on iPhones and iPod Touches, Wired reported on Thursday, citing an agreement it obtained. The settlement provides cash payments to potentially hundreds of thousands of iPhone and iPod Touch owners, who found Apple unwilling to repair or replace their faulty phones under Apple's one-year standard or two-year extended warranty. Apple admits no wrongdoing in the settlement which is expected to be filed in San Francisco federal court in coming weeks and which requires a judge's approval. Models affected include the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, IPhone 3GS, and the first-, second- and third-generation iPod Touch.Â
