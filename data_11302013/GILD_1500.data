Gilead Sciences Inc Announces Response Data From Phase 2 Study Of Idelalisib For Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Wednesday, 15 May 2013 06:30pm EDT
Gilead Sciences Inc announced results from a Phase 2 study (Study 101-08) evaluating idelalisib (formerly GS-1101), an investigational, targeted, oral inhibitor of PI3K delta, in combination with rituximab for older patients with treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This regimen achieved a complete response (CR) rate of 19% and an overall response rate (ORR) of 97%, with estimated progression-free survival (PFS) at 24 months of 93%. Among the 64 patients in study, Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS at 24 months was 93%. The median time on treatment was 14 months, with 33 patients remaining on treatment. The median time to response was two months. No relapses on study have been reported. The nine patients with chromosome 17p deletion (del 17p) (n=6) or mutation in the TP53 gene (n=3), which have been linked to poor prognosis, all responded to therapy including three with a complete response. 94% of patients with thrombocytopenia at baseline responded to treatment (16/17), as did all patients with anemia at baseline (17/17). Of patients with systemic symptoms such as extreme fatigue, fever, night sweats or weight loss (known as B symptoms) at baseline, 77% (20/26) were asymptomatic by eight weeks. Patients completing 48 weeks of therapy without progression could continue to receive idelalisib in an extension study. 43 patients completed 48 weeks of treatment (21 discontinued - 17 due to adverse events, three due to death and one due to other reasons).
