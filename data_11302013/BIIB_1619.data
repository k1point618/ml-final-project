Biogen Idec Inc Announces Collaboration With Leading Research Institutions To Sequence Genomes Of Patients With ALS
Tuesday, 17 Jul 2012 08:00am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc announced that it has entered into a research collaboration with premier academic and research institutions to sequence the genomes of up to 1,000 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in an effort to gain a deeper understanding about the fundamental genetic causes of ALS. Under the terms of the agreements, Biogen Idec will fund the project at the laboratories of David Goldstein, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Human Genome Variation at Duke University, and Richard M. Myers, Ph.D., President and Director of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The researchers will sequence the genomes of approximately 500 patients with ALS over the next two years, with an ultimate goal of sequencing 1,000 ALS genomes within five years. Duke and HudsonAlpha will work with several world-class researchers who have deep expertise and experience with ALS and the genes associated with the disease.Â
