U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s Truvada for Reducing Risk of Acquiring HIV
Monday, 16 Jul 2012 12:45pm EDT
Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved once-daily oral Truvada(emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), in combination with safer sex practices, to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk. Truvada is the first agent to be approved for HIV prevention in uninfected adults, a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). As part of the approval, Gilead worked with the FDA to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to help ensure safe use of Truvada for PrEP as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy.Â
