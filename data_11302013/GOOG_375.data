Reuters reported that the Chinese Commerce Ministry is reviewing Google Inc.'s $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. The ministry's Anti-Monopoly Bureau is looking at the deal, spokesman Shen Danyang said at a regular press briefing. The Anti-Monopoly Bureau's review is a routine part of the acquisition procedure. Under Chinese law, enterprises that run businesses in China and that earn annual revenues of 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) globally and 400 million yuan in China must seek government approval for a proposed acquisition.Â
