eBay Inc To Power Data Center With Renewable Energy-Reuters
Thursday, 21 Jun 2012 03:46am EDT
Reuters reported that eBay Inc said it plans to build a data center powered by startup Bloom Energy's renewable energy fuel cells, a more environmentally-friendly alternative to drawing power from the mostly coal-based electric grid. The U.S. online auction sales group will use 30 Bloom Energy servers that use biogas derived from renewable organic waste and will only use the grid as a back-up source of power.Â
