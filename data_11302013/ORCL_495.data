Oracle Corp's Q4 2013 Sales Disappoint Wall St. Again; Issues Q1 2014 EPS Guidance In Line With Analysts' Estimates-AP

The Associated Press reported that Oracle Corp is still having trouble closing enough business software deals to keep Wall Street happy. The quarterly results announced June 20, 2013 could escalate investors' fears about Oracle's ability to adapt to the changing demands of its customers. Businesses and government agencies are increasingly buying software through monthly or annual subscriptions that enable employees to access applications on any machine with an Internet connection. This "cloud computing" approach is a shift from Oracle's traditional approach of licensing software that is installed on individual computers kept on the premises of its customers. The Company also announced that for the first quarter of 2014, it expects earnings to be in the range from $0.56 to $0.59 per share. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts are expecting the Company to report $0.58 for the first quarter of 2014.Â
