Biogen Idec Inc and Regulus Therapeutics Inc Form Collaboration to Explore microRNA Biomarkers for Disease Monitoring and Response to Therapy
Wednesday, 15 Aug 2012 04:05pm EDT
Regulus Therapeutics Inc announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Biogen Idec Inc to identify microRNAs as biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS). Under the transaction, Biogen Idec will make an investment in Regulus in addition to upfront and milestone payments. The key objective of the collaboration is to identify microRNA biomarkers in the blood of patients with MS. Regulus believes that microRNA biomarkers may be used to select optimal patient segments in clinical trials, to develop companion diagnostics, and to monitor disease progression or relapse.Â
