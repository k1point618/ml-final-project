Oracle Corporation Seeks New Trial Against SAP AG Over Downloads-Reuters
Monday, 6 Feb 2012 09:32pm EST
Reuters reported that Oracle Corporation rejected a potential $272 million award against SAP AG over copyright infringement allegations, instead opting for a new trial after a U.S. judge had slashed over $1 billion from a previous verdict. In a court filing on Monday, Oracle said a new trial would be the only way to 'vindicate the verdict of the jury'. SAP will continue to work to bring the case to a 'fair and reasonable' end. A Northern California jury had determined that Oracle should be paid $1.3 billion over accusations SAP subsidiary TomorrowNow wrongfully downloaded millions of Oracle files. U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton last year found that Oracle had proven actual damages of only $272 million. Oracle could accept a $272 million award, or opt for a new trial against SAP. Oracle had 'no choice' but to seek a new trial. Accepting the $272 million award would risk waiving its right to appeal Hamilton's post trial ruling, Oracle said. TomorrowNow pleaded guilty to 12 criminal counts in September, and agreed to pay a $20 million fine. Under that deal, U.S. prosecutors agreed they would not charge SAP with any criminal wrongdoing.Â
