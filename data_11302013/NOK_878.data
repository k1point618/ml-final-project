Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Files Class Action Suit Against Nokia Oyj
Thursday, 3 May 2012 04:14pm EDT
Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP (Robbins Geller) announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Nokia Oyj (Nokia) publicly traded securities during the period between October 26, 2011 and April 10, 2012 (the Class Period). The complaint charges Nokia and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Nokia provides telecommunications infrastructure hardware, software, and services worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants told investors that Nokia`s conversion to a Windows platform would halt its deteriorating position in the smartphone market. It did not. This became apparent on April 11, 2012, when Nokia disclosed that its first quarter performance would be worse than expected. Nokia expected its first quarter 2012 non-IFRS Devices & Services operating margin to fall by 3%, and projected first quarter 2012 Devices & Services net sales of EUR4.2 billion. It also disclosed a glitch in its newest Windows offering - the Lumia 900. Nokia had to immediately offer customers an automatic $100, making the phone essentially free. As a result of this disclosure, the price of Nokia`s American Depositary Shares (ADRs) dropped over 16% in a single day.Â
