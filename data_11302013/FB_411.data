Saturday, 16 Jun 2012 05:31pm EDT
Reuters reported that Facebook Inc has agreed to pay $10 million t o charity to settle a lawsuit that accused the site of violating users' rights to control the use of their own names, photographs and likenesses. The lawsuit, brought by five Facebook members, alleged the social networking site violated California law by publicizing users' 'likes' of certain advertisers on its 'Sponsored Stories' feature without paying them or giving them a way to opt out. The settlement was reached last month but made public this weekend. The proposed class-action lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, could have included nearly one of every three Americans, with billions of dollars in damages, according to previous court documents.Â
