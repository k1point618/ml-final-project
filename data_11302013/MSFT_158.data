Microsoft Corp Says Wins Patent Trial Against Google Inc's Motorola-Reuters
Wednesday, 4 Sep 2013 09:32pm EDT
Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp said a jury decided in its favor in the second of two trials in federal court in Seattle concerning Motorola Mobility's licensing of so-called standard, essential patents used in Microsoft products. The jury agreed with Microsoft's claim that phone maker Motorola, owned by Google Inc, broke agreements with standard-setting bodies to license certain patents at a fair and reasonable rate, according to Microsoft. The jury awarded Microsoft about $14 million in damages, Microsoft said, about half what the Company had asked for. That consisted of $11 million for the costs of relocating a warehouse in Germany due to an injunction on certain Microsoft products brought by Motorola in Germany, and about $3 million in legal fees for fighting that injunction. A Motorola spokesman indicated the company would appeal.Â
