EU Fines Microsoft Corp $731 Million For Failed Promise, Warns Others-Reuters
Wednesday, 6 Mar 2013 09:00am EST
Reuters reported that the European Union (EU) fined Microsoft Corp EUR561 million on Wednesday for failing to offer users a choice of web browser, an unprecedented sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in EU antitrust disputes. The U.S. software company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Explorer browser. An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honour that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July 2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice. Microsoft said it took full responsibility for the incident, which in the past it has blamed on a technical error. It did not say whether it would challenge the ruling, but it is not expected to do so, in part not to antagonise regulators.Â
