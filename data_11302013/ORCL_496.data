Oracle Corp announced that on June 11, 2013, United States District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrongentered judgment in Oracle's favor against defendants ServiceKey, LLC and its CEO, Angela Vines, on Oracle's claims against ServiceKey and Vines for copyright infringement, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse and Lanham Acts, fraud, intentional interference with prospective economic relations and unfair competition. The judgment reflects ServiceKey's and Vines' admission to liabilityon Oracle's claims. ServiceKey and Vines, among other things, admitted that they illegally and without authorization downloaded, copied and distributed Oracle's copyrighted Solaris Operating System, including Solaris software updates and patches, falsely advertised their ability to provide the copyrighted Oracle Solaris patches to customers, and illegally trafficked in passwords to Oracle's customer support website. As part of the judgment against Service Key and Vines, the Courtissued an injunction that prohibits the defendants from engaging in a wide range of conduct that had led to Oracle's lawsuit. The Court's injunction mandates that ServiceKey and Vines may not "give, receive, sell or otherwise provide to anyone any Oracle/Sun software and/or support materials, including any updates, bug fixes, patches, media kits or other proprietary software support materials, and including any patches, bug fixes or updates to the Solaris Operating System."Â
