Morgan & Morgan Announces Investigation Of Hewlett-Packard Co
Tuesday, 27 Nov 2012 10:41am EST
Morgan & Morgan announced that it is investigating into whether the officers and directors of Hewlett-Packard Co. breached their fiduciary duties to the shareholders in connection with Hewlett Packard's acquisition of Autonomy Corp. PLC (Autonomy). No decision to file a lawsuit has been made. On November 20, 2012, Hewlett Packard announced it would take an $8.8 billion write down on its August 2011 acquisition of Autonomy, a British software firm. On this news, HP's stock price fell $1.59 per share (12%) to close at $11.71 - its lowest price in over ten years. HPQ's CEO Meg Whitman explained that this write down was largely caused by Autonomy's intentional manipulation of its financial metrics before the acquisition, an accusation rejected by Autonomy's former CEO.Â
