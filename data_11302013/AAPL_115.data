Apple Inc Infringes On Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc Patent, ITC Judge-Reuters
Tuesday, 24 Apr 2012 02:40pm EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc infringed on a Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc patent in making its iPhones, iPads and other products, a judge for the International Trade Commission ruled on Apr 24, 2012. ITC Judge Thomas Pender said in a preliminary ruling that Apple infringed on a patent for eliminating noise and other interference during voice and data transmissions. The full commission will now review the judge's decision and issue a final ruling in August. Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc, also accused Apple of violating three other patents - including one for touchscreen technology - but the ITC judge did not back up Motorola Mobility's claims. Motorola Mobility had asked for the infringing devices to be barred from importation into the United States. Apple noted that it was found to have not infringed on three patents in the case. Motorola Mobility has filed related lawsuits against Apple in district courts in Illinois and Florida.Â
