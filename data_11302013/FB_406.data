Thursday, 21 Jun 2012 01:30pm EDT
HEADLINE CORRECTED TO READ - "InNova Files Patent Infringement"... INSTEAD OF... "Facebook Inc Files Infringement". Longview, Texas-based InNova Patent Licensing LLC announced that it has filed patent infringement lawsuits against 24 tech companies accused of infringing an InNova patent used in e-mail spam technology. The Lanier Law Firm represents InNova in its claims against Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., PayPal Inc., eBay Inc., LinkedIn Corp., Comcast Corp and other technology and communications companies. The lawsuits, including InNova Patent Licensing, LLC v. Facebook Inc., No. 2:12-cv-00363, were filed June 21, 2012, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall. The federal patent claim focuses on an InNova patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,018,761, that covers technology used to differentiate between spam e-mail messages and those that users actually want to receive. The lawsuit alleges that the defendant companies have used InNova's patented e-mail technology for years without permission.Â
