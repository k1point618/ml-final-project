Apple Inc Presses Case For Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Sales Ban In Appeals Filing-Reuters
Thursday, 20 Dec 2012 06:00pm EST
Reuters reported that Apple Inc battling Samsung Electronics Co Ltd over patents in several countries, argued on Thursday that a U.S. appeals court should reconsider its decision to overturn a pretrial sales ban on Samsung for infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October overturned a pretrial sales ban ordered by a lower court in California. The order was to stop sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone. Apple argued that this was inappropriate and asked for an 'en banc review', which means that a larger panel of judges would reconsider the decision made by the three-judge panel in October. Apple argued that the sales ban should be reinstated because it uses the patent in question and competes with Samsung. The three-judge panel had said that consumers did not buy Samsung phones primarily because of the patent, and thus, a sales ban was inappropriate. It has become increasingly difficult for companies to win sales bans related to patent infringement in recent years. Such sales injunctions have been a key for companies trying to increase their leverage in courtroom patent fights.Â
