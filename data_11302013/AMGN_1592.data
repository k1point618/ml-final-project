Amgen, Inc. Presents Final Results From Phase 3 Open-Label Study Assessing Safety And Efficacy Of Nplate
Tuesday, 13 Dec 2011 04:11pm EST
Amgen, Inc. announced that data from several key Nplate (romiplostim) studies were presented at the Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), December 10-13, 2011, in San Diego. Of note, final results from the international, Phase 3, open-label, single-arm '209 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Nplate in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) demonstrated that Nplate induced a rapid platelet response in adult ITP patients with low platelet counts or bleeding symptoms and maintained a consistent safety profile (Abstract No. 3279). In the study, incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients treated with Nplate were consistent with those reported in previous studies. The most common side effects included headache, arthralgia and fatigue. Approximately 90% of patients achieved each of the platelet response definitions, regardless of splenectomy status. Median time to response was one to two weeks. Over the course of the study, a doubling of the platelet count to greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter was achieved by 91% of patients who received Nplate. A platelet count increase of greater than or equal to 20,000 platelets per microliter from baseline was achieved by 93% of patients who received Nplate.Â
