Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB Publ and Biogen Idec Inc Announce Positive Top-Line Results from Phase 3 Study Investigating Recombinant Factor IX FC Fusion Protein in Hemophilia B
Wednesday, 26 Sep 2012 07:30am EDT
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB Publ announced that it has together with Biogen Idec Inc announced positive results from B-LONG, a clinical study that evaluated a new long-lasting clotting factor candidate in people with hemophilia B. Top-line results from B-LONG, a global, multi-center, Phase 3 clinical study of the companies' long-lasting recombinant Factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc), showed that rFIXFc was effective in the control and prevention of bleeding, routine prophylaxis, and perioperative management. Recombinant FIXFc was generally well-tolerated. Additional analyses of the B-LONG study are ongoing and the companies anticipate presenting further results at a future scientific meeting. Biogen Idec plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the United States Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2013. Consistent with guidelines published by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that require a study in children less than 12 years of age prior to filing, Biogen Idec and Sobi expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application with the EMA upon completion of the ongoing Kids B-LONG study. In the B-LONG study, 123 male patients aged 12 years and older were enrolled. The B-LONG study had four treatment arms: weekly prophylaxis, individualized interval prophylaxis, episodic treatment and perioperative management (Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Overall, 93.5% of patients completed the study.Â
