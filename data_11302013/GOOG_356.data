EU Offers Google Inc. Last Chance In Antitrust Case-Reuters
Monday, 21 May 2012 03:51pm EDT
Reuters reported that the European Union's antitrust Chief on Monday ratcheted up the pressure on Google Inc., giving it a matter of weeks to settle an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour and avoid formal charges and a possible fine. Even if Google, offers concessions to resolve the issue, it will still be under the EU spotlight after fresh complaints about its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones. The European Commission launched an investigation into Google in November 2010 after competitors, including Microsoft, accused the company of manipulating search results to promote its own advertising services while demoting those of rivals. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said regulators were as eager as Google to avoid lengthy proceedings due to rapid developments in the technology industry and that if remedies were offered by Google within the coming weeks, the antitrust investigation could be brought to a close.Â
