Thursday, 15 Nov 2012 08:00am EST
Cisco Systems Inc announced the intent to acquire privately held Cloupia, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based software company that automates converged data center infrastructure -- allowing enterprises and service providers to simplify the deployment and configuration of physical and virtual resources from a single management console. Upon the close of the acquisition, Cloupia employees will be integrated into Cisco's Data Center Group. Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay approximately $125 million in cash and retention-based incentives in exchange for all shares of Cloupia. The acquisition is expected to be complete in the second quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2013.Â
