Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sàrl's Phase II Study Evaluates Clinical Benefit of Pomalidomide in Heavily Pre-Treated Patients with Multiple Myeloma
Monday, 12 Dec 2011 07:03pm EST
Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, announced that its oral therapy pomalidomide was evaluated as a potential treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy that includes REVLIMID (lenalidomide) and bortezomib. The trial, MM-002, was a randomized open-label Phase II study evaluating pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone versus pomalidomide alone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. Pomalidomide, with or without low-dose dexamethasone, was given in 28-day cycles: pomalidomide 4 mg once daily on days 1-21 every 28 days, and low-dose dexamethasone (40 mg) weekly. Results presented were based on investigator-assessed responses for the intent-to-treat population. A total of 221 patients were enrolled in the study, and 191 patients were available for response. The study showed that out of 191 evaluable patients, partial response (PR) or better was seen in 34% of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone compared with 13% of patients treated with pomalidomide alone. Objective responses (minor response or better) were observed in 45% of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone compared with 29% in the pomalidomide-only arm. Median progression-free survival, the primary end point of the study, was 4.7 months in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm compared with 2.7 months in the pomalidomide-alone arm.
