Gilead Sciences Inc Announces New Sustained Viral Response Data For Sofosbuvir-based Regimens In Genotype 3-Infected Hepatitis C Patients
Saturday, 2 Nov 2013 09:01am EDT
Gilead Sciences Inc announced results from two studies, the Phase 3 VALENCE study and the Phase 2 LONESTAR-2 study, evaluating the investigational once-daily nucleotide analogue sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among patients infected with genotype 3 HCV. These data will be presented at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (The Liver Meeting 2013) taking place in Washington, D.C. In the Phase 3 VALENCE study, 85% (n=212/250) of treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV who received a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (RBV) achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). Patients who achieve SVR12 are considered cured of HCV infection. Additionally, the Phase 2 LONESTAR-2 study evaluated 12 weeks of sofosbuvir, RBV and pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) among patients who had previously failed treatment with peg-IFN/RBV, approximately half of whom had cirrhosis. In this study, 83% (n=20/24) of genotype 3 patients achieved SVR12. There were few discontinuations due to adverse events in VALENCE and LONESTAR-2. Sofosbuvir was well tolerated in VALENCE and adverse events in LONESTAR-2 were consistent with the safety profile of peg-IFN/RBV.
