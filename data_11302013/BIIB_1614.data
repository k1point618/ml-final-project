FDA Extends Review Of Biogen Idec Inc's Multiple Sclerosis Drug-Reuters
Thursday, 18 Oct 2012 11:00am EDT
Reuters reported that Biogen Idec Inc said U.S. health regulators extended by three months the review date of its much-awaited multiple sclerosis (MS) drug BG-12, but analysts said the delay was only a minor setback. "The registrational studies for BG-12 – DEFINE and CONFIRM – enrolled about 1,200 and 1,400 patients, respectively. Given the size and complexity of the filings, we are not surprised that the FDA would require additional time to review the application," Barclays Capital analyst Anthony Butler said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it needed additional time to review the application, but did not ask for additional studies, according to Biogen. The oral drug is currently also under regulatory review in the European Union, Australia, Canada and Switzerland.
