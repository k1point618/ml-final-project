Microsoft Corp Loses EU Battle, Fine Trimmed By 4.3%-Reuters
Wednesday, 27 Jun 2012 09:32am EDT
Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp lost its appeal against an EU decision penalising it for defying an antitrust ruling, bringing nearer to an end a decade-long battle with the European Commission over the U.S. software group's business practices. Judges at the General Court reduced Microsoft's fine by 4.3% to EUR860 million ($1.1 billion) from the 899 million imposed in 2008. The 2008 fine - about $1.3 billion at the time amounted to just over 2% of Microsoft's revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The European Commission imposed the penalty four years ago - a record at the time - after Microsoft defied an antitrust ruling issued four years previously to provide information to make business easier for its rivals. The EU regulator said at the time Microsoft delayed implementing its order for 488 days.Â
