Cisco Systems Inc Taps Two Executives In CEO Race-Reuters
Thursday, 4 Oct 2012 05:36pm EDT
Reuters reported that Cisco Systems Inc is expanding the roles of two executives it has identified as possible successors to long-serving Chief Executive (CEO) John Chambers. Chambers, who took the helm at Cisco in 1995 and has said he aims to step down in two to four years. Cisco appears to be taking a cue from other large U.S. firms like media giant Disney that are seeking a smooth CEO transition by tapping possible heirs years in advance. Chief Operating Officer Gary Moore, will also assume the role of President overseeing end-to-end operations and aligning all businesses with Cisco's long-term strategy. Rob Lloyd, who has led the Company's global operations since April 2009, will assume responsibility for Cisco's development and sales units.Â
