Berger & Montague, P.C. Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Facebook Inc
Friday, 25 May 2012 08:00pm EDT
Berger & Montague, P.C. announced that on May 23, 2012, it has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on behalf of all persons who purchased the common stock of Facebook Inc pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's May 18, 2012 initial public offering (the IPO or the Offering). Investors who bought Facebook may move the court to appoint them as lead plaintiff no later than July 23, 2012. The Complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus contained untrue statements of material facts, omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that Facebook was experiencing a severe reduction in earnings growth and that, while the IPO roadshow was in progress, the Company guided the underwriters to materially lower their earnings forecasts for 2012. During the roadshow conducted in connection with the IPO, each of the lead underwriters reduced its second quarter and full year 2012 earnings estimates for Facebook, which constituted material information that was not shared with all Facebook investors, but rather, was selectively disclosed by defendants to certain large institutional investors and omitted from the Registration Statement and/or Prospectus.Â
