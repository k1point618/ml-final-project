Seoul Court Rules Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Did Not Violate Apple Inc.'s Design-Reuters
Friday, 24 Aug 2012 12:04am EDT
Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's flagship Galaxy smartphone looks very similar to Apple Inc.'s iPhone, but the South Korean firm has not violated the iPhone design, a Seoul court ruled on Friday. The South Korean ruling comes as the two technology titans are locked in a high-stakes global patent battle that mirrors a fierce rivalry for industry supremacy between two companies that control more than half the world's smartphone sales. The Seoul court ruling on Friday comes ahead of more crucial U.S. verdicts. Nine jurors began deliberation on Wednesday in California in one of many disputes between the two firms around the world that analysts see as partly aimed at curbing the spread of Google Inc's Android, the world's most used mobile software.Â
