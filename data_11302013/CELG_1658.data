Celgene Corporation Mulls Human Genome Sciences Inc Bid-Reuters
Friday, 6 Jul 2012 06:47pm EDT
Reuters reported that Celgene Corporation is one of two companies discussing whether to bid for Human Genome Sciences Inc, which seeks an alternative to a hostile offer by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Conventional wisdom among investors has been that Human Genome was unlikely to find another bidder, as Glaxo reaps 50% of the profit from the lupus drug Benlysta, to which Glaxo and Human Genome share the rights. Human Genome has so far refused Glaxo's $13 per share, or $2.6 billion offer as too low and Wall Street analysts (surveyed by Reuters in May) had predicted that bid would need to be raised to about $15 per share to succeed. According to a source familiar with the situation, two companies are in discussions with Human Genome, aside from Glaxo, with Celgene probably in the pole position should it decide to bid. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the media, did not identify the second bidder but said it would most likely be a merger-of-equals scenario. The deadline for bids is July 16.Â
