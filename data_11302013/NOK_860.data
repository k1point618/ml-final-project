Dow Jones reported that Nokia Oyj is selling its Vertu luxury handset business to private equity firm EQT, in a bid to raise cash. The sale is expected to close in the second half of 2012, follows an ongoing strategic review of non-core assets that could include further divestments of other assets. Nokia said it would retain a minority shareholding of 10% in Vertu, leaving EQT's VI fund with a 90% ownership. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Â
