The companies expect to combine a number of divisions into the new group, called the Pivotal Initiative - by the second quarter of 2013 and said the specific operational structure will be determined then. The companies will provide an update on the details of the plans in the first quarter of next year, EMC said. The move will combine EMC's data analytics division Greenplum and its Pivotal Labs group with VMware's vFabric, SpringSource and Gemstone units as well VMware's data analytics company Cetas and CloudFoundry, a cloud computing platform as a service.
