U.S. Judge Backs Microsoft Corp In Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. Patent Dispute-Reuters
Wednesday, 11 Apr 2012 03:30pm EDT
Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp won a ruling in a Seattle court effectively preventing phone company Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. from immediately obtaining an injunction in Germany that could stop Microsoft from selling its Xbox and other software products there, due to a patent disagreement. Last week Microsoft announced plans to move its European distribution center to the Netherlands from Germany ahead of a German court decision expected on April 17, concerned that the court might side with Motorola and grant an injunction barring sales of its products in the country on the grounds that they infringe on a video technology patent owned by Motorola. A judge in U.S. District Court in Seattle granted Microsoft a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order against Motorola in Germany, the software company said. That means Motorola will not be able to get an injunction enforced barring sales of Microsoft products in Germany after the hearing on April 17, but must wait until the issue is settled to take any such action, if warranted.Â
