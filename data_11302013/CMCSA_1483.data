Reuters reported that four Hollywood studios were named on Wednesday in lawsuits brought by two directors and a representative for late actor Charles Bronson claiming what could be up to hundreds of millions of dollars in back royalties on films distributed to the home video market. News Corp's 20th Century Fox, Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures, Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures and Sony Corp's Sony Pictures were sued in Los Angeles Superior Court. The four lawsuits - described in a release as a class action - were also filed on behalf of others who might be added later, said Neville Johnson, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. He said the amounts owed talent on such contracts could total hundreds of millions of dollars.Â
