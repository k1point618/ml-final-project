Thursday, 21 Nov 2013 03:11am EST
Reuters reported that Nokia Oyj has asked the Delhi High Court to help revoke a seizure of its Indian factory by the local tax authorities, seeking to resolve the dispute ahead of the sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft. Nokia said it did not expect the tax dispute to affect its EUR5.4 billion ($7.3 billion) deal with Microsoft, but added that it was prepared for the possibility that the Chennai plant will not be transferred to the U.S. company in time for the sale, which is due to close in the first quarter of next year.Â
