TiVo, Inc. Countersues Cisco Systems, Inc. As DVR Patent Battle Heats Up-Reuters
Monday, 4 Jun 2012 12:49pm EDT
Reuters reported that TiVo Inc countersued Cisco Systems, Inc. in a court over alleged infringement of four patents relating to digital video recorder (DVR) technology, days after Cisco filed a lawsuit against TiVo to void those same patents. Cisco sells DVRs through its Scientific Atlanta division to companies such as AT&T Inc, Time Warner Cable Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. TiVo has resisted granting a broad license to Cisco's DVR technology because doing so would impede TiVo's capacity to bring, and ultimately settle, lawsuits over its patents, a key source of revenue, Cisco said in a complaint filed last week. In the court filing, Cisco said TiVo has asserted infringement of its patents against Cisco customers including Verizon. TiVo had also asked the court that Cisco be ordered to pay compensatory damages to the DVR maker, court documents show. The case is TiVo Inc vs. Cisco Systems, Case No. 2:12-cv-00311, U.S. District Court, Eastern District Of Texas, Marshall Division.Â
