Pittsburgh Law Office of Alfred G. Yates Jr., P.C. Files Class Action Lawsuit On Behalf of Shareholders of Hewlett-Packard Co
Tuesday, 18 Dec 2012 05:38pm EST
Law Office of Alfred G. Yates Jr., P.C. announced that it has filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of purchasers of Hewlett-Packard Co common stock during the period between August 19, 2011 and November 20, 2012 (the Class Period). The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants concealed that the Company had gained control of Autonomy in 2011 based on financial statements that could not be relied upon because of serious accounting manipulation and improprieties. As a result of defendants' false and misleading statements, the Company's stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, reaching a high of $29.89 per share on February 16, 2012. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of HPQ.Â
