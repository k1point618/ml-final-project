Biogen Idec Inc Announces New Data From Phase 3 Studies For Oral BG-12 (Dimethyl Fumarate) In Multiple Sclerosis
Friday, 12 Oct 2012 02:00am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc announced new data from studies evaluating oral BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate), which provide further evidence supporting strong clinical and radiological effects in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and reinforce favorable safety profile seen to date. In a pre-specified analysis of integrated, or pooled, data from the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, dimethyl fumarate showed statistically and clinically relevant effects in reducing multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and progression of disability, as well as reductions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of disease activity. In addition, interim safety data from a Phase 3 extension study indicate that continued exposure to dimethyl fumarate did not result in any new or worsening safety signals, and that safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with previous studies.Â
