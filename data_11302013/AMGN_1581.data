UCB SA and Amgen, Inc. Initiate Sclerostin Antibody Phase 3 Program in Patients with Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Wednesday, 4 Apr 2012 01:00am EDT
UCB SA and Amgen, Inc. announced the start of their sclerostin antibody (CDP7851/AMG 785) Phase 3 clinical trial program for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The Phase 3 program includes a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-year study in more than 5,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary endpoint will evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures at 12 months. Initial results from the Phase 3 program are expected by the end of 2015. CDP7851/AMG 785 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin, a protein secreted by bone cells that inhibits bone formation. By binding to and blocking sclerostin, CDP7851/AMG 785 is designed to increase the amount of bone in the skeleton. With more than 75 million people worldwide suffering from osteoporosis, there is a serious patient need for therapeutics that help build bone. Amgen and UCB are collaborating on the development of CDP7851/AMG 785 for the treatment of bone-related conditions, including postmenopausal osteoporosis and fracture healing.Â
