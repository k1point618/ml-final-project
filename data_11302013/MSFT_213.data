For Airtel, the partnership will help boost intent to derive a larger portion of revenue from data services and for Microsoft, the tie-up will give it easy access to a pool of potential customers in India who prefer to pay for software based on what they use instead of the traditional model of high upfront investment for licences. As part of the contract, Microsoft will sell Office 365 Software - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote - as a service, with the actual software hosted on from Bharti Airtel's data centres.Â
