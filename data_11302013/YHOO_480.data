Yahoo! Inc. Issues Q1 2012 Guidance; EBIT Guidance Below Analysts' Estimates
Tuesday, 24 Jan 2012 04:05pm EST
Yahoo! Inc. announced that for the first quarter of 2012, it expects ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1.025-$1.105 billion. Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12% of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC within cost of revenue. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. GAAP revenue for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1.170-$1.260 billion. Income from operations (EBIT) for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $105-$155 million. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts were expecting the Company to report revenue of $1.078 billion and EBIT of $179 million for the first quarter of 2012.Â
