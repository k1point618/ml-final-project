Eastman Kodak Co Extends Patent Auction Deadline As Talks Continue; Microsoft Corp And Others Made Bids-Reuters
Monday, 13 Aug 2012 08:46pm EDT
Reuters reported that Eastman Kodak Co extended its patent auction on Monday, saying it would not announce a winner as planned because it was still in discussions with bidders. The auction was ongoing. The Company expected later on Monday to submit regulatory filings revealing more information about its business, including financial projections. It is unclear how much the patent sale will raise. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Apple Inc., Google Inc and Microsoft Corp made bids, but they were significantly below Kodak's estimates for the patents' value.Â
