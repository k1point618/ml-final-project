Apple Inc. Launches New Legal Attack On Samsung Phones-Reuters
Monday, 13 Feb 2012 12:51am EST
Reuters reported that Apple Inc raised the stake in an intensifying global patent battle with Samsung Electronics by targeting the latest model using Google's Android software. Apple has asked a federal court in California to block Samsung from selling its new Galaxy Nexus smartphones, which use Google's newest version of Android, called Ice Cream Sandwich, alleging four patent violations including new features such as a voice command search function. In a lawsuit filed in San Jose, Apple said the Galaxy Nexus infringes on patents underlying features customers expect from Apple products. Those include the ability to unlock phones by sliding an image and to search for information by voice.Â
