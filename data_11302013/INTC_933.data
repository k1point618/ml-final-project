Intel Corporation Eyes Internet-Based TV Service-Reuters
Monday, 12 Mar 2012 06:54pm EDT
Reuters reported that Intel Corporation is developing an Internet-based TV service for consumers and has been promoting it with media companies, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Company plans to create a 'virtual cable operator' that would offer media companies' TV channels in a bundle over the Internet. The product could use an Intel set-top box and Intel's name, and the chipmaker has told its potential partners it wants to start the service before the end of the year. In October, Intel wound down its efforts to make chips for digital 'smart' TVs, although it continues to make chips for set-top boxes.Â
