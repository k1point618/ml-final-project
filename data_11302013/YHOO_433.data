Wednesday, 20 Nov 2013 09:06pm EST
Yahoo! Inc announced the pricing of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of its 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the notes). The offering was upsized from the previously announced $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Yahoo also has granted to the initial purchasers of the notes the right to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes, exercisable within a 30-day period, solely to cover over-allotments. The offering is scheduled to close on or about November 26, 2013. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Yahoo`s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Yahoo`s election, based on an initial conversion rate of 18.7161 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Yahoo estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $1.23 billion, after deducting the initial purchasers` discount and estimated offering expenses payable by Yahoo. Yahoo expects to use approximately $100.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate as Yahoo`s agent. The remaining net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, additional repurchases of common stock and working capital.Â
