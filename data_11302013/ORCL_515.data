Judge In Google Inc, Oracle Corporation Case Seeks Names Of Paid Reporters, Bloggers-Reuters
Tuesday, 7 Aug 2012 11:00pm EDT
Reuters reported that Google Inc and Oracle Corporation's copyright and patent battle took a strange twist on Tuesday, after a judge ordered the companies to disclose the names of journalists, bloggers and other commentators on their payrolls. U.S. District Judge William Alsup said he was concerned that Google and Oracle and/or their counsel may have retained or paid people who may have published comment on the case. The order, several months after a jury found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, hints at the possibility of a hidden world of for-pay press coverage and injects uncertainty into the widely-followed case. Alsup issued a one page order but did not go into full details of the court's concerns.Â
