Apple Inc Filing Could Delay Eastman Kodak Company Patent Sale-Reuters
Thursday, 21 Jun 2012 06:55pm EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc asked a federal judge to move a lawsuit against it by Eastman Kodak Co to a new court, which could derail the photography pioneer's plan to quickly sell a large patent portfolio through the bankruptcy process. Kodak had sued Apple, seeking to stop the largest U.S. company by market value from claiming ownership of 10 patents, including for technology that helps camera owners preview photographs on LCD screens. These patents are part of a digital-capture portfolio of more than 700 patents for devices such as digital cameras, smartphones and tablets. But in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Apple said the dispute should be reviewed by a jury in a federal district court, not as Kodak wishes by a judge in a federal bankruptcy court, where there are no juries. Apple also said that while it is amenable to a reasonably-expedited proceeding, it should be in district court, because a bankruptcy judge lacks the power and expertise to get involved. The case is Apple Inc v. Eastman Kodak Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-04881. Kodak's lawsuit is Eastman Kodak Co v. Apple Inc et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-ap-01720. The bankruptcy case is In re: Eastman Kodak Co et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-10202.Â
