Friday, 16 Nov 2012 07:00am EST
Accenture PLC announced that it is working with SAP AG to help global oil and gas companies improve their operational performance and efficiencies with upstream solutions. Accenture and SAP will work closely with these companies to extend the current capabilities of SAP solutions by integrating operational functions that span engineering, production, maintenance, finance, and environment, health and safety (EH&S). Cooperation between Accenture and SAP will be centered initially on leveraging SAP applications, including SAP Upstream Operations Management and SAP Production and Revenue Accounting, to address the needs of integrated digital oilfield operations. Accenture will leverage Accenture Advanced Enterprise Solution (AAES) to deliver SAP solutions that are custom built for oil and gas upstream operations. AAES links Accenture's industry insights and experience into a set of practices, processes and technologies that is packaged for rapid deployment and provides more predictable, high quality results. The objective is to help these companies take immediate advantage of new innovations, such as analytics, mobility, in-memory and database technology, including the SAP HANA platform. Accenture will also work with SAP to incorporate global requirements and new functionality into the SAP solutions, building out a fully global hydrocarbon solution for upstream oil and gas.Â
