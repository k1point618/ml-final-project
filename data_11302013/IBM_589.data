Thursday, 14 Mar 2013 05:39pm EDT
Reuters reported that International Business Machines Corp (IBM) and Emc Corp are among parties in talks to buy privately held database web hosting company SoftLayer Technologies Inc, in a deal that could fetch over $2 billion. Dallas, Texas-based SoftLayer has hired Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to run the sale process, asking not to be named because the talks are private. SoftLayer's sale process was initially spurred by one of its customers, AT&T Inc, which approached the company in recent months seeking exclusive talks. AT&T is no longer involved in the process.Â
