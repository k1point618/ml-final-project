Judge Cuts Apple Inc Award Versus Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sets New Damages Trial-Reuters
Friday, 1 Mar 2013 06:57pm EST
Reuters reported that Apple Inc had a major setback in its ongoing mobile patents battle with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Friday, as a federal judge slashed a $1.05 billion jury award by more than 40% and set a new trial to determine damages. Apple won the award last year against Samsung in what was the biggest and highest-profile of a number of legal trials around the world, centered on the use and alleged abuse of patents in a highly competitive mobile market. The iPhone maker convinced the jury that the Korean company had infringed on its iPhone and iPad patents. Friday's ruling by Judge Lucy Koh of the U.S. District Court Northern District of California in San Jose means the two mobile electronics companies may once again square off in a California court to decide how much of the $450.5 million struck from the damages, associated with 14 Samsung products, should stand. Koh said the jury had incorrectly calculated part of the damages and that a new trial was needed to determine the actual, final dollar amount. That could end up less than or more than the original $450.5 million set by the jury. Koh, rejecting Apple’s motion for an increase in the jury’s damages award, ordered a new trial on damages for the 14 devices, which include the Galaxy SII. The jury’s award to Apple for 14 other separate products, totaling almost $599 million, was maintained.
