Through this acquisition, Amgen will acquire worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to KAI-4169. In connection with the parties' entering into the agreement, Amgen has provided a loan to enable Phase 3 clinical development planning for KAI-4169 prior to closing. The transaction has been approved by the stockholders of KAI and approved by the Board of Directors of each company. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Following the completion of the transaction, KAI will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor and Latham & Watkins acted as legal advisor to KAI on the transaction. Amgen was advised by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.Â
