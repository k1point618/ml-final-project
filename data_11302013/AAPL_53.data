Apple Inc Loses Tablet Copyright Appeal Against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd-Reuters
Thursday, 18 Oct 2012 08:27am EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc has lost its appeal against a ruling that cleared Samsung Electronics Co Ltd of copying its registered designs for tablet computers. Britain's Court of Appeal on October 18, 2012 upheld the country's High Court judgment that, despite some similarities, Samsung's Galaxy tablet did not infringe Apple's designs. The decision is valid throughout Europe and should prohibit further legal disputes between the two companies over the design of tablets in the region.Â
