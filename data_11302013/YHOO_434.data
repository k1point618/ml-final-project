Yahoo! Inc To Offer Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018; Increases Share Buyback Authorization
Tuesday, 19 Nov 2013 04:57pm EST
Yahoo! Inc announced that it proposes to offer $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2018 (the notes). Yahoo also intends to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes the right to purchase up to an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes, exercisable within a 30-day period, solely to cover over-allotments. Yahoo intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. Yahoo may use up to $200.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate as Yahoo`s agent. Yahoo expects the purchase price per share in such transactions to equal the closing price per share of Yahoo`s common stock on the date of pricing of the offering. The remaining net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, additional repurchases of common stock and working capital. However, Yahoo has not designated any specific uses of the net proceeds and has no current agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisition or strategic transaction. The Company also announced that it has increased its share buyback authorization by $5.0 billionÂ
