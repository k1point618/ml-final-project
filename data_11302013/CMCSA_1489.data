Comcast Corp. Buys Out Microsoft Corp Stake In MSNBC.com-Reuters
Monday, 16 Jul 2012 02:08am EDT
Reuters reported that Comcast Corp., the parent company of NBC, has bought out Microsoft Corp's 50% stake in MSNBC.com for about $300 million to assume full control of the news web site. MSNBC.com was renamed NBCNews.com and users were automatically redirected to the new website. NBC and Microsoft joined forces in 1996 to create a cable news channel and online news operation that melded broadcasting with then-emerging internet technology.Â
