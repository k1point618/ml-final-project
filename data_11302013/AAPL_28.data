Apple Inc Challenges Loss Of iPhone Trademark In Brazil-Reuters
Thursday, 14 Feb 2013 08:33am EST
Reuters reported that Apple Inc, which lost the rights to its iPhone trademark in Brazil on february 13, 2013, is challenging the ruling by Brazil's copyright regulator to prevent local firm Gradiente Eletronica SA from using the iphone brand name. The regulator, Inpi, ruled on february 13, 2013 that the rights to the trademark belong to Gradiente, prompting California-based Apple to request that the decision be reviewed in Latin America's market. Consumer electronics maker Gradiente had filed its request to use the iphone brand in 2000, seven years before Apple launched its smartphone, but received approval to use the trademark only in 2008. Now, in order to keep its trademark rights, Gradiente will need to prove to the regulator in the next 60 days that it made use of the trademark between January 2008 and January 2013, Inpi said late on february 13, 2013.Â
