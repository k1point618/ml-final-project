Wednesday, 30 Oct 2013 10:51am EDT
Reuters reported that a British court found in favor of Nokia Oyj in a patent infringement case against Taiwan-based mobile phone manufacturing rival HTC Corporation, according to a court document. Nokia communicated that the Company would seek compensation as well as an injunction against the import and sale of HTC products in Britain. The ruling follows a September ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which found that HTC infringed on two Nokia patents in making its mobile telephones and tablets.Â
