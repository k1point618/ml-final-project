Sunday, 13 Jan 2013 05:57pm EST
Reuters reported that Oracle Corp released an emergency update to its widely used Java software for surfing the Web on Sunday, days after the U.S government urged PC users to disable the program because of a bug it said made computers vulnerable to attack by hackers. Java security expert Adam Gowdiak, who has discovered several bugs in the software over the past year, said that the update from Oracle leaves unfixed several critical security flaws. Oracle said on its security blog on Sunday that its update fixed two vulnerabilities in the version of Java 7 for Web browsers.Â
