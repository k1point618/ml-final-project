Amgen, Inc. Receives Complete Response Letter From FDA for XGEVA sBLA for Prevention of Bone Metastases
Thursday, 26 Apr 2012 10:01pm EDT
Amgen, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Complete Response Letter for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for XGEVA (denosumab) to treat men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) at high risk of developing bone metastases. The Complete Response Letter states that FDA cannot approve the application in its present form. The FDA determined that the effect on bone metastases-free survival (BMFS) was of insufficient magnitude to outweigh the risks (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) of XGEVA in the intended population, and requested data from an adequate and well-controlled trial(s) demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit profile for XGEVA that is generalizable to the U.S. population.Â
