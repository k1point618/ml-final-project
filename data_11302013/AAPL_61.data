Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Wins Over Apple Inc In Japan Patent Case-Reuters
Friday, 31 Aug 2012 12:26am EDT
Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's mobile devices did not violate an Apple Inc patent, awarding the Samsung Electronics a victory a week after it lost a patent case in the United States. The Tokyo District Court's ruling on an Apple patent dealing with transferring media content between devices comes after a U.S. federal jury found a week before that Apple did not infringe on any of Samsung's patents, while the Samsung Electronics had copied key features of the iPhone. The U.S. jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages and it is seeking bans on the sale of eight Samsung phones in the U.S. market.Â
