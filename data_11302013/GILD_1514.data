Gilead Sciences Inc announced that a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF; formerly referred to as GS-7340), an investigational prodrug of tenofovir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, met its primary objective.

The TAF-based regimen achieved a similar virologic response to Stribild based on the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels (viral load) of less than 50 copies/mL at 24 weeks of therapy (87% versus 90%, respectively). Compared to Stribild, the TAF-based regimen demonstrated statistically significantly smaller reductions from baseline to week 24 in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip (p
