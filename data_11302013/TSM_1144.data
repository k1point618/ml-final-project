Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. And ARM Holding Plc Collaborate To Optimize 64-bit ARM Processors For FinFET Process Technology
Monday, 23 Jul 2012 03:00am EDT
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and ARM Holding Plc announced a multi-year agreement extending their collaboration beyond 20-nanometer (nm) technology to deliver ARM processors on FinFET transistors. The collaboration will optimize the 64-bit ARM processors based on the ARMv8 architecture, ARM Artisan physical intellectual property (IP), and TSMC's FinFET process technology for use in mobile and enterprise markets that require both high performance and energy efficiency. The collaboration will enable sharing of technical information and feedback between the two companies, enhancing the development of ARM IP and TSMC process technology. ARM will leverage process information to optimize the power, performance and area (PPA) of the overall solution to reduce risk and encourage early adoption. TSMC will use the latest ARM processors and technology and tune advanced FinFET process technologies. The combination of TSMC FinFET technology and ARMv8 architecture provides the fabless industry with solutions for continued innovation across diverse market segments. The collaboration will result in improved silicon process, physical IP and processor technology that together will enable new system-on-chip (SoC) innovation and shorten time-to-market.Â
