Hewlett Packard Co Resolves Ink Cartridge Patent Infringement Lawsuit With Brazil's Multilaser
Tuesday, 29 May 2012 07:45am EDT
Hewlett Packard Co announced that it has amicably resolved patent litigation with Brazil-based Multilaser Industrial Ltda. relating to HP's integrated printhead inkjet cartridges. As part of the settlement, Multilaser acknowledges that HP's patents are valid and were infringed upon. Multilaser has agreed to stop selling the cartridges in question in Brazil and in other countries where HP has corresponding patent rights. Multilaser also will reimburse part of the litigation costs to HP. The settlement is based on litigation filed by HP in the Brazilian State Court of Sao Paulo on April 12, 2011, alleging the importation and sale of HP-compatible inkjet print cartridges in Brazil that infringe on HP patents.Â
