Apple Inc And Google Inc's Motorola Unit File Separate Patent Appeals- The Economic Times
Sunday, 22 Jul 2012 08:00pm EDT
The Economic Times reported that Apple Inc and Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit filed separate appeals of a federal judge's June 22 order dismissing their mutual patent- infringement claims. US Circuit Judge Richard A Posner threw out the companies' claims about two weeks after he rejected each mobile-phone maker's damages theories and cancelled a jury trial that had been set for June 11 in federal court in Chicago. The appeal notices , which also involved earlier rulings, were filed there on July 22, 2012. That trial would have been the first between Apple, the maker of the iPhone and Google, creator of the Android smart phone operating system, since the California-based company completed its $12.5-billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in May. Motorola was pressing a claim that Cupertino, California-based Apple infringed a cellular technology patent , while Apple accused Motorola of violating four patents. After rejecting each companies' theories on damages, Posner agreed to hear arguments on whether either company was entitled to injunctive relief.Â
