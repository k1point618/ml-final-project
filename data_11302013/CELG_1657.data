Thursday, 12 Jul 2012 07:30am EDT
Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation announced top-line results from the PALACE-1 study, the first of three pivotal phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the Company’s oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) in patients with psoriatic arthritis who had received an oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), biologic therapy or had failed on an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent. Apremilast treatment in this study was used alone or in combination with an oral DMARD. In the study, statistical significance for the primary endpoint of ACR20 was achieved for patients receiving apremilast. Patients in the active treatment arms also maintained significant improvements in arthritis-related endpoints, including ACR50 and ACR70 through week 24. Significant and sustained improvements in various measures of physical function were also observed in apremilast-treated patients. The overall safety profile was consistent with previous experiences in the phase II program and tolerability was improved. Common side effects for PDE4 inhibitors have been gastrointestinal in nature. In the PALACE-1 study, gastrointestinal adverse events, upper respiratory tract infections, as well as headache, were no more common in apremilast-treated patients than in those receiving placebo. The PALACE-1 study is ongoing and study extension remains blinded until all patients complete week 52.
