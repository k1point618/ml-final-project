Oracle Corporation's Attorney Rules Out Settlement With Hewlett-Packard Co-Reuters
Wednesday, 2 May 2012 09:09pm EDT
Reuters reported that an Oracle Corporation attorney ruled out a settlement with Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) in a bitter lawsuit over the Itanium microprocessor, a day after the judge refused to resolve the case for either side before trial. At a hearing in a San Jose court on Wednesday, Oracle attorney Dan Wall said a settlement of the lawsuit isn't going to happen. Oracle said in a court filing last wee that HP is seeking about $4 billion in lost profit damages from Oracle, which argues that HP's claims are meritless. But HP argues that Oracle and HP had agreed that support for Itanium would continue, without which the HP equipment using the chip would become obsolete. HP said that commitment was affirmed when it settled an earlier lawsuit over Oracle's hiring of former HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd.Â
