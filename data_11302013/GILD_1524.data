Gilead Sciences, Inc. Initiates Phase 3 Clinical Trial Evaluating GS-1101 For Treatment Of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Tuesday, 1 May 2012 06:00pm EDT
Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of GS-1101 (formerly CAL-101). GS-1101 is an investigational, first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform and is being evaluated in combination with rituximab in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The Phase 3 trial (Study 116) will enroll 160 patients at approximately 70 sites in the United States and Europe. CLL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow overproduces lymphocytes, leaving less room in the blood and bone marrow for other blood cells. CLL is the second most common form of leukemia, according to the National Cancer Institute, which estimates there will be 16,000 new diagnoses and approximately 4,500 deaths in the United States from the disease in 2012.Â
