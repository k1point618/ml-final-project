Biogen Idec Inc And Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announce Global Collaboration For Antisense Program Targeting Myotonic Dystrophy
Friday, 29 Jun 2012 08:00am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that they have entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and collaboration agreement under which the companies will develop and commercialize a antisense drug for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which is also known as Steinert disease. Isis’ DM1 antisense program is being developed to correct the underlying genetic defect that causes DM1. Isis will receive an upfront payment of $12 million and is responsible for the discovery of a lead antisense drug candidate targeting DMPK for the treatment of DM1. Isis is eligible to receive up to $59 million in payments associated with the clinical development of the DMPK-targeting drug prior to licensing. Biogen Idec has the option to license the drug from Isis up through the completion of the Phase 2 trial. Isis could receive up to another $200 million in a license fee and regulatory payments. In addition, Isis will receive double-digit royalties on sales of the drug. Isis will be responsible for global development of the drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials, with Biogen Idec providing advice on the clinical trial design and regulatory strategy. If Biogen Idec exercises its option, it will assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities.
