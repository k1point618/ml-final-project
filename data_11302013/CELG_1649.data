Celgene Corp's Abraxane Improved Pancreatic Cancer Survival In Trial-Reuters
Friday, 9 Nov 2012 07:33pm EST
Reuters reported that Celgene Corp said on November 09, 2012 that a clinical trial of Abraxane, its drug to treat breast and lung cancer, improved survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. The Company did not give details of the extent of the improvement, saying it would do so at a medical meeting in January, but said the results were statistically significant. Patients were given either Abraxane plus the chemotherapy, gemcitabine, or gemcitabine alone. Those in the Abraxane group on average survived longer. Patients with advanced forms of pancreatic cancer, such as those tested in the Celgene trial, typically live 5.6 to 6.8 months following diagnosis, according to Dr. Daniel Von Hoff, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead investigator on the trial. The side effects seen in the trial were similar to those seen in earlier trials, Von Hoff said, and included a decrease in white blood cells, which can increase the chance of infection, numbness and tingling in the fingers, and nausea. The Company expects to release detailed data from the trial at a medical meeting in January and plans to file an application with regulators to market the drug to treat pancreatic cancer, as well as breast and lung cancer.Â
