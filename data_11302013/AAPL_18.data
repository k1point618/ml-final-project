EU Regulator Monitors Apple Inc iPad And iPhone Distribution-Reuters
Friday, 22 Mar 2013 06:49pm EDT
Reuters reported that the European Union (EU) is looking into potential antitrust violations involving the distribution of Apple Inc's iPhones and iPads, after receiving what sources said were informal complaints from telecoms operators. The complaints involve handset subsidies and marketing that the technology corporation sign-off with operators that carry its smartphones and tablets, and also includes subsidies that carriers pay to Apple. U.S. and European operators pay hefty subsidies to smartphone makers including Apple, offering customers an attractive discount on devices in exchange for tying them into lucrative two-year wireless contracts.Â
