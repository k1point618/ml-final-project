Amazon.com Inc Buys Map Startup UpNext-Reuters
Monday, 2 Jul 2012 06:47pm EDT
Reuters reported that Amazon.com Inc reportedly agreed on Monday to buy mapping startup UpNext. GigaOM reported that UpNext Founders Raj Advani, Vik Advani, Robin Har and Danny Moon will move from New York to Seattle, where Amazon is based, to lead the e-commerce company's mapping efforts. The technology news service did not report a purchase price, but said UpNext backers, including Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital, will get a five-fold return on their investment, made about 16 months ago. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment and UpNext's Moon did not respond to a phone message left seeking comment on Monday afternoon.Â
