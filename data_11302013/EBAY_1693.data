eBay Inc announced that it is updating its third quarter 2012 and fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share guidance to account for the expected impact of its $3 billion debt offering, which priced earlier on July 19, 2012. Closing of the offering is scheduled for July 24, 2012. Based on the pricing of the debt offering announced, the Company expects that the $3 billion public debt offering will increase its interest expense by approximately $32 million in 2012, including the amortization of debt discount and offering expenses. Assuming the closing of the offering, for the third quarter of 2012, eBay expects net revenues in the range of $3.300-$3.400 billion, which is unchanged from the amounts in the Company's July 18, 2012 earnings release. However, eBay now expects GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.41-$0.43 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.52-$0.54 for the third quarter of 2012. For fiscal 2012, eBay expects net revenues in the range of $13.800- $14.100 billion, which is unchanged from the amounts in the Company's July 18, 2012, earnings release. However, eBay now expects GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.89-$1.94 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) in the range of $2.28-$2.33 for fiscal 2012. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts on an average were expecting the Company to report revenue of $3.399 billion for the third quarter of 2012 and revenue of $14.002 billion for fiscal 2012.Â
