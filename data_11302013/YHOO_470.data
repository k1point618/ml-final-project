Yahoo! Inc. Confirms Taking Important Steps To Reshape The Company For Future; Expects To Recognize Majority Of Estimated $125-$145 Million Pretax Cash Charge In Q2 2012
Wednesday, 4 Apr 2012 09:15am EDT
Yahoo! Inc. confirmed that it is taking important next steps to reshape Yahoo! for the future. Through its restructuring efforts, Yahoo! intends to grow by responding more quickly to customer needs and competing more effectively in areas where it can win. Yahoo! has identified key parts of the business, a select group of core businesses, the platforms that support those core businesses, and the data that drives deep personalization for users and ROI for advertisers, where Yahoo! will intensify efforts and redeploy resources globally, all focused on increasing shareholder value. With a clear focus on profitability and growth, Yahoo! will be disciplined in its investments and radically simplify how it builds, launches and maintains many of its properties and products. Today, Yahoo! will begin the process of informing employees about these changes. As part of that effort, approximately 2,000 people will be notified of job elimination or phased transition. Yahoo! expects to realize approximately $375 million of annualized savings upon completion of all employee transitions. Yahoo! currently expects to recognize the majority of an estimated $125 to $145 million pretax cash charge relating to employee severance in its second quarter financial results. Yahoo! may incur additional charges in connection with this action. More information will be provided about Yahoo!’s future direction in conjunction with the release of its first quarter financial results on April 17, 2012.
