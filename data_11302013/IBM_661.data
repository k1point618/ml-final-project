CMA CGM Group and International Business Machines Corp announced a new strategic partnership. Under the terms of the five-year agreement, IBM will provide industry-specific expertise in new technologies such as cloud computing and analytics, and support CMA CGM's growth by delivering information technology services that will help CMA CGM significantly reduce costs. The IT teams from the two companies will be merged into a new subsidiary, CMA Systems, which will have an equally represented governance structure and report directly to Jacques Saade, chairman and chief executive officer of CMA CGM.
