Amazon.com Inc To Win EU e-book Pricing Tussle With Apple Inc.-Reuters
Tuesday, 6 Nov 2012 05:48pm EST
Reuters reported that European Union regulators are to end an antitrust probe into e-book prices by accepting an offer by Apple Inc. and four publishers to ease price restrictions on Amazon.com Inc. That decision would hand online retailer Amazon a victory in its attempt to sell e-books cheaper than rivals in the fast-growing market publishers hope will boost revenue and increase customer numbers. In September, Apple and the publishers offered to let retailers set prices or discounts for a period of two years, and also to suspend 'most-favoured nation' contracts for five years. Such clauses bar CBS Corporation's Simon & Schuster, The News Corporation unit HarperCollins, Lagardere SCA's Hachette Livre and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, the owner of German company Macmillan, from making deals with rival retailers to sell e-books more cheaply than Apple. The agreements, which critics say prevent Amazon and other retailers from undercutting Apple's charges, sparked an investigation by the European Commission in December last year. Pearson Plc's Penguin group, which is also under investigation, did not take part in the offer.Â
