Biogen Idec Inc And Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB Presents New Data From Phase 3 Study Of Long-Lasting Hemophilia Factor Candidate ALPROLIX
Tuesday, 2 Jul 2013 11:00am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB announced that it presented new findings for their long-lasting recombinant factor IX candidate ALPROLIX for hemophilia B at the XXIV International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Congress in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Three oral presentations showcase new data that reinforce the potential safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of ALPROLIX. The data highlight the consistency of results with ALPROLIX across patient types and favorable physician ratings of efficacy in treating acute bleeding episodes and controlling bleeding during and after surgery. An evaluation of the treatment of acute bleeding episodes across the prophylaxis and episodic (on-demand) treatment arms of the phase 3 B-LONG study showed that more than 90% of bleeds were controlled with a single injection of ALPROLIX and more than 97% were controlled with two or fewer injections. Results from an analysis of the phase 3 B-LONG study showed that ALPROLIX consistently controlled bleeding during and after 14 surgeries in 12 patients with hemophilia B. Physicians reported high efficacy levels of ALPROLIX during surgery, with hemostasis (the stoppage of bleeding) rated as excellent for 13/14 surgeries and good for 1/14 surgeries.Â
