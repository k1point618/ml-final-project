Google Inc's Motorola Mobility Unit Can Not Enforce German Microsoft Corp Injunction-Ruling-Reuters
Saturday, 29 Sep 2012 07:49pm EDT
Reuters reported that a U.S. appeals court on Friday ruled that Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit cannot enforce a patent injunction that it obtained against Microsoft Corp in Germany, diminishing Google's leverage in the ongoing smartphone patent wars. The injunction would have barred Microsoft from 'offering, marketing, using or importing or possessing' in Germany some products including the Xbox 360 and certain Windows software. The ruling against the German injunction came from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.Â
