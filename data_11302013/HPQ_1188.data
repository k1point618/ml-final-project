Britain's Fraud Prosecutor Sees No Conflict In Hewlett-Packard Co's Autonomy Probe-Reuters
Thursday, 3 Oct 2013 03:00pm EDT
Reuters reported that Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on October 3, 2013 it had found no conflict of interest in its investigation into Autonomy, the British software company accused of accounting irregularities by its U.S. owners Hewlett-Packard Co. SFO head David Green said the investigation was proceeding into allegations that the U.S. computer and printer maker was duped when it bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011. The SFO said in March it might be using an Autonomy product, Introspect, as a document management tool and therefore needed to establish whether it could continue a criminal investigation into how the British company was sold.Â
