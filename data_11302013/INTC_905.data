Intel Corp Wins Patent Appeal Against N-Data-Reuters
Monday, 17 Dec 2012 01:29pm EST
Reuters reported that Intel Corp won an appeal in a patent fight with Negotiated Data Solutions LLC (N-Data) over ethernet patents that make it possible for computers to easily talk to one another. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Monday that Intel did not infringe the patents because it had licensed them from National Semiconductor Corp in 1976. National had assigned the patents to Vertical Networks Inc in 1998, which assigned them to N-Data. Based on the licensing agreement, Intel won the case in a Texas court on summary judgment. The appeals court agreed.Â
