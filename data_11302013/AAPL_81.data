German Court Upholds Ruling In Tablet Battle Between Apple Inc And Samsung Electronics Co Ltd-Reuters
Tuesday, 24 Jul 2012 06:32am EDT
Reuters reported that a German court on Tuesday upheld a ruling in favour of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, denying a request by Apple Inc. to ban sales of the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab model in Germany. The ruling by the Duesseldorf Higher Court reiterated a decision by the District Court in February. The court decision comes as executives of both companies have disagreed about the value of each other's patents at a settlement conference ahead of a high profile U.S. trial. The Duesseldorf court on Tuesday said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd could continue selling the revised model in Germany. At the same time the court said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd could not sell the older, smaller and less popular Galaxy Tab 7.7 in the entire European Union.Â
