Biogen Idec Inc Raises FY 2012 Guidance-Conference Call
Thursday, 25 Oct 2012 08:00am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc announced that it expects fiscal 2012 revenue growth of mid- to high-single digits, a modest improvement over prior guidance. The Company also announced that it anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) to be between $6.40 and $6.50, and GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.63 and $5.73, an increase from previous guidance by approximately $0.20. This is due to the combination of the gain from the BENLYSTA-related transaction and the strength in the core business. The Company reported revenue of $5.049 billion in fiscal 2011. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts on an average were expecting the Company to report revenue of $5.492 billion and EPS of $6.43 for fiscal 2012.Â
