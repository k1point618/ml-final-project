Monday, 7 Jan 2013 07:26am EST
Gilead Sciences Inc announced that MacroGenics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company that develops next generation antibody therapeutics, has entered into a license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. for the development and commercialization of Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) products directed at up to four undisclosed targets. MacroGenics' DART technology is a bi-specific antibody platform in which a single recombinant molecule is able to target two different antigens. Under the terms of the agreement, MacroGenics could receive a total of up to $30 million in license fee payments, and up to an additional $85 million in pre-clinical milestones across the four DART programs. Gilead has exclusive worldwide rights for three of the programs. For one program, MacroGenics retains development and commercialization rights outside of North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, which encompasses multiple markets including Japan, China, Korea, Brazil, Russia and others. Gilead will fully fund MacroGenics' research activities with respect to the four programs. MacroGenics could also receive up to approximately $1 billion in clinical, regulatory and commercialization payments if all four programs achieve the requisite milestones. Finally, MacroGenics may receive tiered (up to low double-digit) royalties on future net sales.Â
