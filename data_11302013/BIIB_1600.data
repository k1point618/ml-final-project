FDA Accepts Biogen Idec Inc's Biologics License Application For First Long-Lasting Factor VIII Therapy For Hemophilia A
Monday, 13 May 2013 07:30am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Company`s Biologics License Application (BLA) for the marketing approval of ELOCTATE (recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein) for the treatment of hemophilia A. ELOCTATE is the first hemophilia A product candidate in a new class of long-lasting clotting factor therapies being developed with the goal of providing long-lasting protection and reducing the burden of treatment for patients with this chronic condition. ELOCTATE is a clotting factor developed using Biogen Idec`s novel and proprietary monomeric Fc fusion technology, which makes use of a naturally occurring pathway to delay the destruction of factor and cycles it back into the bloodstream, resulting in a longer circulating half-life.Â
