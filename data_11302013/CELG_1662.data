Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sàrl Multiple Analyses Evaluating ABRAXANE (Nab-Paclitaxel) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Saturday, 2 Jun 2012 07:49pm EDT
Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation announced results from multiple presentations evaluating ABRAXANE (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer during the 48th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, Ill. The two reports presented data from retrospective analyses of CA-031, the phase III, multi-center, randomized study where patients received either nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) weekly plus carboplatin (AUC=6) every three weeks (n=521) or paclitaxel (200mg/m2) every three weeks plus carboplatin (AUC=6) (n=531) as first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the data from CA-031, Celgene submitted an sNDA for ABRAXANE for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2011. The current PDUFA date for the submission is Oct. 12, 2012. Results of this study published ahead of print on April 30, 2012 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology demonstrated a higher overall response rate (ORR), the approved primary end-point of the study based on a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), for patients in the nab-paclitaxel arm compared to those in the paclitaxel arm (33% vs. 25%, p=0.005).
