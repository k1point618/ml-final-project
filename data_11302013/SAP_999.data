Friday, 4 Oct 2013 08:16pm EDT
Reuters reported that BlackBerry Ltd on the block as its smartphone business struggles, is in talks with Cisco Systems Inc, Google Inc and SAP AG about selling them all or parts of itself. The Company, based in Waterloo, Ontario, has asked for preliminary expressions of interest from potential strategic buyers, which also include Intel Corp, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, by early next week. It is unclear which parties will bid, if any. But the potential technology buyers have been especially interested in BlackBerry's secure server network and patent portfolio, although doubts about the assets’ value remain an issue. Google, Intel, Cisco, LG and SAP declined to comment. Samsung was not immediately available for comment.
