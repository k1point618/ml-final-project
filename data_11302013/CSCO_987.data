Comptel Oyj and Cisco Systems Inc. Settle Dispute under Arbitration
Thursday, 19 Apr 2012 01:00pm EDT
Comptel Oyj (Comptel) announced that Comptel Corporation and Cisco Systems Inc. (Cisco) have settled the dispute concerning Comptel’s use of a certain sub-set of Axioss software that was sold to Cisco and simultaneously licensed back to Comptel for use in the current release of Comptel Fulfillment. Cisco brought the matter to the London Court of International Arbitration in December 2011. In accordance with the settlement, the parties have agreed to withdraw all their claims against each other and the arbitration process has thereby been terminated. It has been agreed that no financial compensation will be made between the parties. Comptel will continue in the fulfillment business and will, consistent with the terms of Cisco’s license back to Comptel, support its existing Axioss and Comptel Fulfillment customers.
