Monday, 20 Aug 2012 09:39pm EDT
Reuters reported that the Chief Executives of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have talked but did not settle the high stakes patent dispute between the two electronics companies, a Samsung attorney said in court. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh had requested that the two talk on the phone at least once more before the jury begins deliberating this week. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute that mirrors the struggle for industry between the two rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales.Â
