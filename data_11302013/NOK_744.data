Nokia Oyj's HERE Delivers Precise Indoor Location Content to Qualcomm-DJ
Thursday, 1 Aug 2013 06:01am EDT
Dow Jones reported that Nokia Oyj's HERE will make available its indoor Venue Maps to Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated. Venue Maps complement Qualcomm Atheros' end-to-end IZat indoor positioning capabilities to deliver always-on location awareness to mobile devices in more places. IZat is comprised of Qualcomm Atheros' technology portfolio, including cellular, global navigation satellite system (GNSS), Wi-Fi, sensor and cloud-based assistance solutions, as well as its widely deployed location core, already found in more than one billion devices on mobile networks worldwide. Venue Maps will help Qualcomm IZat location technologies deliver more precise positioning (within 3-5 meters) to mobile devices inside buildings. Improving the overall indoor location experience for consumers, this combination is expected to accelerate the development and use of compelling location-based experiences as well as promotions in shopping malls, transportation hubs and entertainment venues around the globe.Â
