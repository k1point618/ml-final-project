Wednesday, 23 Oct 2013 04:14pm EDT
Reuters reported that Starbucks Corp which has doubled down on its tea bet, is opening its first Teavana tea bar in New York City this week. Starbucks' Manhattan Teavana store is due to open on October 24, 2013 and aspires to have a zen-like atmosphere fragrant with spices. The shop will also sell food such as chocolate brioche. Starbucks said it would decide later whether to add tea bars to existing Teavana stores. Schultz said the Company would likely add overseas locations while it expanded its U.S. business.Â
