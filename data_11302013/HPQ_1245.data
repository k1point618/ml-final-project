Hewlett-Packard Co Resolves Ink Cartridge Patent Infringement Lawsuit With Brazil's Maxprint
Wednesday, 19 Sep 2012 07:45am EDT
Hewlett-Packard Co announced that it has amicably resolved patent litigation with Brazil-based Rio Branco Ltda., distributor of the Brazilian brand Maxprint, relating to HP's integrated printhead inkjet cartridges. As part of the settlement, Maxprint acknowledges that HP's patents are valid and enforceable. Maxprint has agreed to stop selling the cartridges in question in Brazil and in other countries where Maxprint-brand cartridges are sold. HP and Maxprint have agreed to allow Maxprint to sell any remaining inventory until December 1, 2012, after which all infringing product sales by Maxprint must cease. Maxprint also will reimburse part of the litigation costs to HP. The settlement is based on litigation filed by HP in the Brazilian State Court of Sao Paulo on April 12, 2011, alleging the importation and sale of HP-compatible inkjet print cartridges in Brazil that infringe on HP patents.Â
