European CHMP Adopts Positive Opinion For Gilead Sciences Inc's Stribild, Once-Daily, Integrase Inhibitor-Based, Single Tablet Regimen For Treatment Of HIV-1 Infection
Friday, 22 Mar 2013 08:30am EDT
Gilead Sciences Inc announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has adopted a positive opinion on the Company's Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for the once-daily, single tablet regimen Stribild for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients who are antiretroviral-naïve or are infected with HIV-1 without known mutations associated with resistance to any of the three antiretroviral agents in Stribild. Stribild combines elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor, and cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing agent, with Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate)). The CHMP's positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for use in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU). The regulatory filing for Stribild is supported by 48-week data from two Phase 3 double-blind, active-controlled, randomized studies in which Stribild met primary objective of non-inferiority compared to Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 300 mg) (Study 102) and to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada (Study 103). In all studies, Stribild was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild to moderate. The most common adverse events observed were nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and headache.
