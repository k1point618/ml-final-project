HP Enterprise Services announced that the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) has signed a $89.9 million, five-year contract for Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) to continue as fiscal agent for Rhode Island's Medicaid program and additional state departments. Under the terms of the extension, HP will implement a number of enhancements to existing state systems, including migration of Rhode Island's Medicaid data center operations to a state-of-the-art HP data center. The agreement also contains three option years not included in the contract value. HP also will assume responsibility for and upgrade the EOHHS's data warehouse to address Rhode Island's changing healthcare needs. Enhancements to the EOHHS's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) include increased information sharing across systems and departments, designed to improve decision making related to costs, program administration and beneficiary care.Â
