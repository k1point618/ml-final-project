Tuesday, 24 Apr 2012 09:37am EDT
International Business Machines Corp announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per common share, payable June 9, 2012 to stockholders of record May 10, 2012. This dividend declaration represents an increase of $0.10, or 13% higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share. The Board also authorized $7 billion in additional funds for use in the company’s stock repurchase program. IBM will repurchase shares on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. This amount is in addition to approximately $5.7 billion remaining at the end of March from a prior authorization. With this new authorization, IBM will have approximately $12.7 billion for its stock repurchase program. IBM expects to request additional share repurchase authorization at the October 2012 board meeting.
