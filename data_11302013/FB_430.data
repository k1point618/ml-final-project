Law Firm of Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Investigates Into Possible Securities Laws Violations Relating To Facebook Inc. Initial Public Offering
Tuesday, 22 May 2012 05:49pm EDT
Law Firm of Levi & Korsinsky, LLP announced that it is investigating potential claims on behalf of purchasers of Facebook Inc securities concerning possible violations of federal securities laws. On May 22, 2012, reports surfaced indicating that analysts for at least two of Facebook's lead underwriters revised downward their financial forecasts for the Company while it was holding IPO 'road-show' meetings with investors. These reports also suggest that the revised figures were only passed along to some investors who were therefore able to make profits by selling their IPO shares on 18 May, 2012 while shares were on the rise. The reports further indicate that the chairman of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said regulators plan to review allegations that such information was shared only with certain investors.Â
