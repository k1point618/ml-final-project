Biogen Idec Inc To Acquire Full Rights And Control of TYSABRI From Elan For Upfront Cash and Contingent Payments
Wednesday, 6 Feb 2013 12:15pm EST
Biogen Idec Inc announced that it has agreed to purchase Elan’s interest in TYSABRI (natalizumab) and upon closing will gain full strategic, commercial and decision making rights to TYSABRI. Upon the closing of the transaction, the previous collaboration agreement between the companies, whereby worldwide TYSABRI profits were split 50:50, will be terminated along with the agreement’s change of control provisions. Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen Idec will use its existing cash reserves to make a payment of $3.25 billion to Elan upon the closing of the transaction and make future contingent payments to Elan in an amount equal to 12% of global net sales of TYSABRI for the first twelve months, and thereafter, Biogen Idec will continue to make contingent payments of 18% on annual global net sales of TYSABRI up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual global net sales that exceed $2.0 billion. In 2014 only, the $2.0 billion threshold will be pro-rated for the portion of 2014 remaining after the first 12 months expires. Biogen Idec anticipates the transaction will be approximately $0.20 to $0.30 accretive to 2013 GAAP earnings per share and $0.50 to $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share, and will continue to be accretive thereafter, depending on the sales trajectory of TYSABRI.
