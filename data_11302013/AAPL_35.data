Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Drops Legal Suits Against Apple Inc In Five EU Countries-DJ
Tuesday, 18 Dec 2012 07:45am EST
Dow Jones reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said December 18, 2012 it would drop its requests for legal injunctions against Apple Inc. in five European countries, a U-turn in a long-running patents war between the two tech giants. Injunction applications will be dropped in Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and the Netherlands, a senior Samsung executive told The Wall Street Journal. But Samsung will continue to pursue lawsuits in Europe where it alleges infringements in its products, it said. The Korean electronics giant has been locked in a battle with Apple over standard-essential patents both in the United States and in Europe. Samsung has focused its lawsuits on technology patents rather than those covering design, as Apple has done, while the two firms slug it out for dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets. While Samsung was dealt a heavy blow in the U.S., courts have sided with the South Korean electronics maker in some other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. The move comes a day after a U.S. judge denied Apple's request for a ban on the sale of some Samsung products in the U.S. market, tempering Apple's sweeping win in a California court case this summer. The request withdrawal in those European countries was "unilateral and voluntary", the senior executive said.Â
