Brower Piven Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Hewlett-Packard Co
Tuesday, 4 Dec 2012 01:08pm EST
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announced that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Hewlett-Packard Co (Hewlett Packard or the Company) during the period between August 19, 2011 and November 20, 2012, inclusive (the Class Period). The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the Company's failure to disclose during the Class Period that at the time Hewlett-Packard acquired Autonomy, the business's operating results and historic growth were the product of accounting improprieties, including the mischaracterization of sales of low-margin hardware as software and the improper recognition of revenue on transactions with Autonomy business partners, even where customers did not purchase the products, that at the time Hewlett-Packard had agreed in principle to acquire Autonomy, defendants were looking to unwind the deal in light of the accounting irregularities that plagued Autonomy's financial statements, and that the Company's Enterprise Services (formerly Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS")) business's profit margins suffered from unfavorable revenue mix and underperforming contracts.Â
