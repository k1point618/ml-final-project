Microsoft Corp To Add Google Inc As Defendant In Motorola Patent Fight-DJ
Friday, 12 Oct 2012 03:44pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Microsoft Corp plans to add Google Inc as a defendant in Germany in one of its patent actions against Google's phone maker, Motorola Mobility, marking the first time the two tech giants have come into direct legal conflict over Google's Android mobile software. Microsoft contends that Google's Android infringes its software patents but so far has pursued handset makers rather than Google itself for payment of royalties. Many hardware companies have settled with Microsoft over their use of Android, but Motorola, which Google bought this year, is fighting a range of patent issues with Microsoft in courts in the United States and Germany. In the latest move, Microsoft said in a court in Munich that it plans to add Google as a defendant in a case in which it claims a mapping feature on Motorola phones infringes one of its patents.Â
