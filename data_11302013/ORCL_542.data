Hewlett Packard Company, Oracle Corporation Seek Pretrial Wins In Itanium Case-Reuters
Monday, 26 Mar 2012 11:18pm EDT
Reuters reported that Hewlett Packard Company and Oracle Corporation on Monday both sought pretrial wins in their bitter legal battle over whether Oracle can end support for Itanium, a heavy-duty microprocessor. Oracle decided to discontinue support last year, saying Intel Corp made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and that Intel was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor. But HP argues that the companies agreed support for Itanium would continue in an earlier settlement reached over Oracle's hiring of former HP chief executive Mark Hurd, and has sued Oracle in a California state court, calling Oracle's decision 'anti-customer'. Oracle has countersued, accusing HP of false advertising for failing to disclose the terms of its contract with Intel. Relations between HP and Oracle deteriorated rapidly when Oracle quickly hired Hurd after he left HP in 2010 amid questions about his relationship with a female contractor, with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison publicly criticizing HP's handling of the matter. HP later filed a trade secrets lawsuit against Hurd related to the Oracle hire and although that was soon settled, the firms' mutual acrimony only got worse when HP later hired Ellison's arch-rival Leo Apotheker as CEO. Seeking judgment before the trial which is scheduled to start May 31, HP argued at the time of the Hurd settlement, Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley had said the deal meant that the companies 'would continue to work together' as they had.Â
