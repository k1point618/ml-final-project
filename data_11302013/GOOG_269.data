EU Seeks Feedback On Google Inc Revised Antitrust Offer-Reuters
Monday, 28 Oct 2013 01:03pm EDT
Reuters reported that EU regulators have asked 125 Google Inc rivals and third parties to provide feedback on the company's second attempt to settle a three-year-long antitrust investigation and avert a possible $5 billion fine. The European Commission's hopes of closing the case next spring, however, suffered a setback after several rivals criticised Google's latest offer for not being materially different from a proposal made in April. Google's original proposal in April was rejected by its competitors, who said that the changes would only reinforce the company's dominance. That prompted the EU antitrust authority to demand fresh concessions from the U.S. company.Â
