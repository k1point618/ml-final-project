German Court Grants Victory To Apple Inc. In Patent Suit With Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.-DJ
Friday, 20 Jan 2012 05:05am EST
Dow Jones reported that in the latest setback for Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. in its legal battle against Apple Inc. over intellectual property rights, a German court had ruled that Apple hadn't violated one of its technical patents. The ruling comes after Samsung filed claims with the Mannheim Regional Court in Germany in April last year, alleging Apple infringed some of its telecommunications standard technology patents. The two technology companies are engaged in a legal dispute over more than 30 patent cases in 10 different countries, and the latest German court's decision is significant as it is the first ruling in a series of judgements expected from the German court. Samsung said it will review the details of the ruling before deciding whether it will appeal to a higher court in Germany. The Mannheim court is also due to rule on additional Samsung patents relating to telecommunications standards in the coming days and weeks.Â
