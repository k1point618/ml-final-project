Data Show Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s Quad Regimen For HIV Non-Inferior To Protease-Based Regimen At 48 Weeks In Second Pivotal Phase 3 Study
Thursday, 8 Mar 2012 07:00pm EST
Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced full results from the second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 103) of its Quad once-daily single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV. The study found that the Quad was non-inferior to a protease-based regimen of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) plus Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) at 48 weeks of therapy among HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve adults. At 48 weeks of treatment in Study 103, Quad demonstrated comparable efficacy to the atazanavir-based regimen, with 90% of Quad patients compared to 87% of patients receiving ATV/r plus Truvada achieving HIV RNA (viral load) less than 50 copies/mL, using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm (95% CI for the difference: -1.9% to +7.8%; predefined criterion for non-inferiority was a lower bound of a two sided 95% CI of -12%). Among patients with baseline HIV RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, Quad demonstrated similar efficacy, with 85% of Quad patients compared to 82%of patients receiving ATV/r plus Truvada achieving viral load less than 50 copies/mL. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was comparable among patients taking Quad (4%) and the atazanavir-based regimen (5%). Elevated bilirubin levels (grades 3-4) were observed in 1 percent of patients in the Quad arm, compared to 58% in the atazanavir-based arm.
