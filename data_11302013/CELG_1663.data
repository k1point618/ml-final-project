Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sàrl Announces Results from Randomized Study of REVLIMID (Lenalidomide) and Rituximab (R2) in Patients with Recurrent Follicular Lymphoma

Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, announced results from a randomized study comparing REVLIMID (lenalidomide) plus rituximab to lenalidomide monotherapy in previously treated patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the second most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. In the study, patients received either single-agent lenalidomide (15 mg in cycle 1 and 20 mg in cycles 2-12 administered on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) (n=45) or lenalidomide (15 mg in cycle 1 and 20 mg in cycles 2-12 administered on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) plus rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks in cycle 1) (n=44). A third arm consisting of rituximab as a single-agent was discontinued from the study as a result of low patient accrual. Of the 89 evaluable patients, the objective response rates were 73% for patients receiving combination therapy, with 36% achieving a complete response, compared to 51% for patients receiving the lenalidomide monotherapy, with 13% achieving a complete response. With a median follow-up of 1.7 years (range 0.1 – 4.1 years), the median event-free survival (EFS) for patients in the combination arm was 2 years (p=0.0063), while patients in the lenalidomide monotherapy arm achieved a median EFS of 1.2 years.
