Redknee Solutions Inc Plans To Acquire Business Support Systems From Nokia Oyj And Siemens AG's Nokia Siemens Networks
Wednesday, 5 Dec 2012 03:02am EST
Redknee Solutions Inc announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Nokia Siemens Networks' Business Support Systems (BSS) business. Nokia Siemens Networks' BSS business provides real-time charging, rating, policy, customer care solutions to more than 130 communication service providers, including half of top 100 global mobile operators. Approximately 1200 employees would transfer to Redknee. The acquisition would involve the transfer to Redknee of Nokia Siemens Networks' BSS customer and supplier contracts, intellectual property rights, fixed assets and associated liabilities, along with BSS employees. The employees expected to transfer to Redknee are mainly based in Berlin, Germany; Bangalore, India; and Wroclaw, Poland. Until the agreement closes, Nokia Siemens Networks will work to ensure an orderly migration and transfer of the BSS business. Nokia Siemens Networks would retain a small number of broader customer contracts that include elements of BSS for GSM-R and mobile broadband related mediation. Redknee expects to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on balance sheet and debt facilities. The total consideration paid by Redknee for the BSS business will include EUR15 million in cash at closing, plus a maximum of EUR25 million for certain performance-based cash earn-outs expected to be paid over 12 to 36 months post-closing. The acquisition is anticipated to close in the first half of calendar year 2013.Â
