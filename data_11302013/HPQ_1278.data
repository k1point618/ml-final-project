The Global Accounts Sales organization will join the newly named HP Enterprise Group. This group will be led by David Donatelli and includes Enterprise Servers, Storage, Networking and Technology Services. The new structure is expected to speed decision making, increase productivity and improve efficiency, while providing a simplified customer experience. HP also announced that it will unify its Marketing functions across business units under Marty Homlish, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, HP.

HP's Communications employees worldwide also will be similarly unified under Henry Gomez, executive vice president and chief communications officer, HP. HP is moving the Global Real Estate function from Finance into Global Technology and Business Processes to address real estate consolidation and improve the workplace experience for HP employees.Â
