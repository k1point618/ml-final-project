InterDigital Inc Receives Initial Determination in USITC Patent Infringement Investigation of Nokia Oyj, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE
Friday, 28 Jun 2013 07:20pm EDT
InterDigital Inc announced that it has received notice that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) overseeing the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC or Commission) Investigation No. 337-TA-800 of Nokia Oyj, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE has issued an initial determination (ID) finding no violation of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The ALJ found that one of InterDigital's asserted patents was infringed, but the asserted claims of that patent were found to be invalid in light of prior art. He further found that four of InterDigital's patents were not proven invalid but are not infringed, and that the remaining two asserted patents were invalid and not infringed. Importantly, the ALJ indicated that the respondents have not prevailed on any equitable, FRAND, or license defense. The ALJ also determined that InterDigital satisfied the domestic industry requirement as to all asserted patents.Â
