Hewlett-Packard Co announced that HP Enterprise Services has been awarded two task orders by the U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) to support and enhance the technology infrastructure and applications used throughout the recruiting process. The contracts, sold under the U.S. Army Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -- 2 Services agreement, include 30% small-business participation. The first contract, a three-year order for HP to continue managing the AHRC technology infrastructure, adds the same support for the U.S. Army Cadet Command and Army Recruiting Command. The second contract is a one-year task order to modernize and maintain applications that enable the U.S. Army to easily find and screen prospective recruits with HP Applications Services. HP also will develop a new capability for recruits to complete applications and required federal forms online. These applications run on the AHRC technology infrastructure, and help manage recruitment and hiring workflow.Â
