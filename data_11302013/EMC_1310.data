Guidance Software Inc And Emc Corp's RSA Collaborate On Automated Cyber Security Incident Response
Monday, 17 Sep 2012 08:05am EDT
Guidance Software Inc announced an interoperability partnership with RSA, the Security Division of Emc Corp, to interconnect Guidance’s EnCase Cybersecurity and the RSA enVision security information and event management (SIEM) platform to enable automated incident response and management. The integration will enable the RSA enVision platform to automatically trigger an EnCase Cybersecurity incident response, including exposing, collecting, triaging and remediating data related to threats – essentially taking action on or gathering data about a security event that might otherwise have been inappropriately disregarded. The interoperability of the two solutions will allow organizations to reduce the time it takes to remediate threats, thus reducing the high cost of response and the risk of exposing sensitive data to loss or theft.
