Law Offices of Howard G. Smith Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against General Motors Company
Wednesday, 18 Jul 2012 02:15pm EDT
Law Offices of Howard G. Smith announced that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of a class comprising all persons who purchased the common stock of General Motors Company (GM or the Company) pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s November 18, 2010 initial public offering (the IPO), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Act of 1933. GM designs, manufactures and markets cars, crossover vehicles, trucks and automobile parts worldwide. The Complaint alleges that the Company’s Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO were materially false and misleading. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: GM was predicting revenue based on production rather than actual sales; the Company falsely assured investors that it was actively managing its production by monitoring its dealer inventory levels; and the Company assured investors that its inventory management would improve in 2011, which would improve average transaction price.
