Wednesday, 3 Jul 2013 04:09pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Two federal judges approved a key settlement between JPMorgan Chase & Co. and customers of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. that should free up more than $1 billion for the customers of the defunct brokerage. .S. District Judge Victor Marrero and U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn both approved the deal, which calls for J.P. Morgan to pay $100 million to reimburse customers and back away from $400 million in claims. Among other things, the deal allows foreign MF Global customers to begin getting more money back from the coffers of James W. Giddens, the trustee unwinding MF Global's brokerage.Â
