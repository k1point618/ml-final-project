Spyker NV Opposes Motion of General Motors Co to Dismiss Spyker NV's Complaint
Monday, 12 Nov 2012 02:01am EST
Spyker NV (Spyker) announced that it has opposed the Motion to Dismiss filed by General Motors Co (GM). On September 28, 2012, GM filed a Motion to Dismiss, in which GM asserted that that an agreement (the so-called Framework Agreement), which Spyker, Saab Automobile and Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., Ltd. (Youngman) had drafted, would cause a change of control of Saab Automobile or would cause transfer of GM automotive technology to Youngman. In its opposition, Spyker filed on November 9, 2012 its argument that the carefully crafted Framework Agreement would - contrary to GM's knowingly false media statements at the time - neither have triggered a change of control of Saab Automobile (therefore not requiring GM's consent) nor would have caused a transfer of GM automotive technology (the Opposition). On the contrary, the Framework Agreement would have provided Saab Automobile with a necessary, immediate infusion of cash, which would have permitted it to successfully reorganize without Youngman taking any stake in Saab Automobile. Moreover GM's technology was completely firewalled and Youngman would have had NO access thereto in any way. In the Opposition Spyker further substantiates that a long course of dealings made clear that GM under no circumstances would accept a competitor in the Chinese market. As a consequence of GM's tortious interference, Saab Automobile was forced to enter into liquidation on December 19, 2011.Â
