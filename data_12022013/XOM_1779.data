New Guinea Energy Ltd Announces Sale Of Interest In Ppl 269 To Exxon Mobil Corp's Esso PNG Robin Limited Not To Proceed
Tuesday, 27 Aug 2013 06:00pm EDT
New Guinea Energy Ltd announced that with reference to the announcements of July 26, 2013, regarding the proposed sale of its 50% participating interest in Petroleum Prospecting Licence (PPL) 269 to Esso PNG Robin Limited (Esso), a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Sale Agreement). Esso has advised NGE that it has been unable to reach alignment on a number of confidential commercial matters (which have not been disclosed to NGE) with the other joint venturers in PPL 269 and that Esso will not be proceeding with the Sale Agreement. As the sale of NGE’s interest in PPL 269 to Esso will not be proceeding, consistent with NGE’s strategy of monetising gas assets to focus on exploration for oil in Papua New Guinea, NGE intends to re-engage with other parties who have approached NGE in connection with the possible acquisition of NGE’s interest in PPL 269. NGE will keep the market informed of any developments.
