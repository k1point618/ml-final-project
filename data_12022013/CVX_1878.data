Chevron Corp. Condemns Illegitimate Decision by Ecuador Appellate Court
Tuesday, 3 Jan 2012 06:51pm EST
Chevron Corp. announced that there has been an adverse ruling by the panel of three temporary judges presiding over appellate proceedings in the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbíos in Lago Agrio, Ecuador in an environmental lawsuit involving Texaco Petroleum Company, upholding a lower court’s ruling from February 2011. Chevron continues to seek recourse through legal proceedings outside of Ecuador. In the arbitration proceedings Chevron instituted against Ecuador in The Hague under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, the Tribunal issued an order on February 9, 2011 requiring Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to prevent enforcement of the Lago Agrio judgment until further order of the Tribunal. The Tribunal also recorded that if it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio case was a breach of an obligation Ecuador owed to Chevron as a matter of international law, any loss arising from the enforcement of such judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which Ecuador would be responsible to Chevron under international law. Chevron also is pursuing an action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ representatives for violations of the federal racketeering statute, common-law fraud, and other relief based upon the overwhelming evidence of their fraud and corruption.
