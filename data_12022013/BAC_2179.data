Singapore Reprimands Bank of America Corp And Other Banks After Benchmark Rate Review-Reuters
Friday, 14 Jun 2013 07:59am EDT
Reuters reported that Singapore's central bank has censured UBS AG and 19 other banks on June 14, 2013 after it found traders in the city state tried to manipulate benchmark borrowing and currency rates, and has ordered them to set aside additional reserves for a year. All of the banks on the Singapore's setting panels for interbank lending and currency rates were censured, along with Australia's Macquarie Bank. UBS AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and ING Groep NV have been ordered to set aside the most in additional reserves, with each having to post between an extra SGD1 billion ($799.52 million) and SGD1.2 billion with the central bank. The money will be returned if the banks take the required remedial action. UBS and ING could not immediately be reached for comment. Other banks censured included BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse, DBS, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered PLCÂ
