India investigates Wal-Mart Stores Inc Over Stake In Local Unit-Reuters
Friday, 16 Nov 2012 04:27am EST
Reuters reported that Indian authorities are investigating claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc violated foreign exchange rules when it invested $100 million in a domestic unit owned by its wholesale joint-venture partner, a law enforcement official said. An Indian lawmaker first raised the allegations in a letter to the prime minister in early September, 2012 and the complaint was subsequently passed from one government department to another without action being taken. Wal-Mart has denied any wrongdoing. The allegations relate to the Company's complex investment through debentures which could later be converted to an equity stake at a time when direct ownership by foreign firms was prohibited.Â
