OMV Petrom SA and Exxon Mobil Corp's Exxon Mobil Exploration and Production Romania Limited to Conduct Seismic Program in Black Sea
Wednesday, 5 Dec 2012 10:17am EST
OMV Petrom SA (OMVP) announced that OMVP and ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania Limited (EMEPRL), an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp, together have started a three-dimensional seismic study in the Black Sea (BS). The study covers approximately 6,000 square kilometers in the deep water area of the Neptun Block (NB) in the Romanian sector of the BS. The six-month seismic acquisition program is being performed aboard the CGG Veritas Symphony. The 120-meter long Symphony deploys 12 streamers six kilometers long to collect the three-dimensional seismic data. OMVP is the operator of the seismic program. EMEPRL and OMVP will use data collected from this seismic program and an earlier seismic program from between 2009 and 2010 to further assess the commercial and technical feasibility of the Domino gas discovery announced earlier in 2012. The data also will be used to determine targets for future exploration drilling. EMEPRL is the operator of the deep water sector of the NB. The NB deep water sector covers an area of approximately 9,900 square kilometers in water depths ranging from 50 meters to 1,700 meters. EMEPRL and OMVP signed an agreement in November 2008 for EMEPRL to acquire a 50% interest in the deep water portion of the NB. In January 2012, EMEPRL and OMVP announced the Domino-1 exploration well encountered natural gas in the deep water sector of the NB. The Domino-1 well is located 170 kilometers offshore in water about 1,000 meters deep.Â
