Ford Motor Company To Sell Ohio Auto Lighting Plant To Ventra Sandusky-DJ
Wednesday, 30 May 2012 02:19pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Ford Motor Company has agreed to sell one of its two remaining auto-parts plants, moving it one step closer to completing its global restructuring plan. Ventra Sandusky LLC, a member of the auto-parts maker Flex-N-Gate Group, has agreed to purchase an automotive lighting business as well as a plant in Sandusky, Ohio, while taking over operations of an lighting-parts service operation in Bellevue, Ohio. Ventra Sandusky will employ most of the staff from the Sandusky and Bellevue operations. The terms of the deal, which is expected to close June 30, weren't disclosed. The parts plant is one of two remaining of a group of 17 plants and six other operations that Ford has been trying to sell off or close since October 2005.Â
