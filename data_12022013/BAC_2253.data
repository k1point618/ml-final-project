Judge Dismisses Claims Against Bank of America Corporation And Other Banks In General Electric Co Lawsuit-Reuters
Wednesday, 18 Apr 2012 11:21pm EDT
Reuters reported that a federal judge on Wednesday dismissed claims against Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and 40 other defendants that they helped mislead investors in General Electric Co's $12.2 billion stock offering in 2008. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who took over the case in February, said a January ruling denying the defendents' bid to dismiss claims failed to consider key court rulings and improperly relied on certain statements. Cote's ruling does not entirely dismiss the class action lawsuit filed by GE investors, keeping intact claims that General Electric Co and its Chief Financial Officer, Keith Sherin, made misleading statements about the quality of the company's loan portfolio. The State Universities Retirement System of Illinois, the lead plaintiff, filed the lawsuit in 2009, saying GE and myriad financial firms were responsible for investor losses during a six-month period when GE's stock price fell to about $10 from about $26. The plaintiffs alleged that GE withheld information regarding its health and the health of its GE Capital finance arm, including exposures to subprime and other low-quality loans. They also said GE misleadingly touted itself as being safer than rivals, despite the effects of the financial crisis. Among those dismissed from the lawsuit on Wednesday are Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corporation.Â
