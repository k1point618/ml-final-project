Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc Confirms Receipt Of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposal From Amgen Inc
Sunday, 30 Jun 2013 12:00pm EDT
Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc confirmed that it has received and rejected an unsolicited proposal from Amgen Inc. to acquire all of Onyx's outstanding shares and share equivalents for $120 per share in cash, subject to due diligence and other conditions. The Board of Directors of Onyx had evaluated the proposal made by Amgen with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors and concluded that the price proposed by Amgen significantly undervalued Onyx and its prospects, and was not in the best interest of Onyx or its shareholders. Onyx communicated this determination to Amgen on June 28, 2013. Based upon expressions of interest received from other third parties and the recent proposal from Amgen, the Onyx Board has authorized its financial advisor to contact potential acquirers who may have an interest in the Company in a transaction that is in the best interest of Onyx shareholders. Onyx does not intend to communicate further regarding the Amgen proposal or the process by which the Board of Directors will consider other proposals. There can be no assurance that an improved proposal will be made by Amgen or any other entity, that a definitive agreement will be executed relating to any proposed transaction, or that any transaction will be approved or consummated.Â
