Bernstein Liebhard LLP Files Securities Class Action Against JPMorgan Chase & Co
Tuesday, 15 May 2012 11:37am EDT
Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced that a securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of a class of purchasers of JPMorgan Chase & Co. common stock during the period between April 13, 2012 and May 11, 2012. The Complaint charges JP Morgan and certain of the Company's executive officers with violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendant JP Morgan is a financial holding company, which provides various financial services worldwide. During the Class Period, as alleged in the complaint, Defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding certain securities trading by the Company's Chief Investment Office. Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that the CIO had engaged in extremely risky and speculative trades that exposed JP Morgan to losses. As alleged in the complaint, on May 10, 2012, JP Morgan filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the market closed, JP Morgan held a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss the Form 10-Q. Defendants opened the conference call by revealing that the Company's CIO trading had sustained a multi-billion dollar trading loss. In response to this disclosure, the price of JP Morgan stock declined from $40.74 per share to $36.96 per share on extremely heavy trading volume.Â
