Chevron Corp, Reliance Industries Ltd Sign Preliminary Kurdistan Oil Deal-DJ
Thursday, 19 Jul 2012 06:33am EDT
Dow Jones reported that Chevron Corp has signed a preliminary deal with Reliance Industries Ltd that would see the U.S. company take stakes in two oil exploration blocks in the Kurdish region of Iraq. Such a deal would make Chevron the second major western oil company to enter the Kurdish region, following Exxon Mobil Corp. last year. Chevron's move boosts the position of the Kurdish Regional Government, which has long fought with the Iraqi central government over who has the right to grant oil exploration rights to foreign companies. The deal was signed in the last few days by both companies, said one person close to the Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources. Reliance already holds the oil licenses in question, called Rovi and Sarta.Â
