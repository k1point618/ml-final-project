Biogen Idec Inc And Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc Announce Collaboration For Antisense Programs To Treat Neurological Disorders
Monday, 10 Dec 2012 08:00am EST
Biogen Idec Inc and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that they have entered into a global collaboration agreement under which the companies will discover and develop antisense drugs against three undisclosed targets to treat neurological or neuromuscular disorders. Biogen Idec and Isis are also developing antisense drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy type 1 under previously established collaborations. Under the terms of the agreement, Isis will receive an upfront payment of $30 million and is responsible for the discovery of a lead antisense drug for each of the three undisclosed targets. Isis is eligible to receive substantial development payments to support research and development of each program prior to the exercise by Biogen Idec of its option to license each program. Biogen Idec has the option to license a drug from each of the three programs through the completion of Phase 2 trials. Isis could receive up to another $200 million in a license fee and regulatory payments per program. In addition, Isis will receive double-digit royalties on sales of drugs. Isis will be responsible for development of the drugs through the completion of the initial Phase 2 clinical trial, with Biogen Idec providing advice and assistance on research and the clinical trial design and conduct and regulatory strategy for each program. If Biogen Idec exercises its option, it will assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities.Â
