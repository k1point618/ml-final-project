Amgen Inc Drug Cut Cholesterol Up To 66% In Statin Patients-Reuters
Tuesday, 6 Nov 2012 03:46pm EST
Reuters reported that Amgen Inc's experimental cholesterol-lowering drug, AMG145, reduced levels of bad cholesterol up to 66% in patients already taking statin drugs, according to results from a mid-stage trial that were presented on November 06, 2012. The findings were in line with other AMG145 studies showing significant reductions in LDL cholesterol that were unveiled this week at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Los Angeles, California. The latest study of 629 patients is the largest trial so far of a drug in a new class of injectable biotech drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. The Phase 2 trial showed a mean reduction in LDL versus a placebo of 42% for patients injected with 70 mg of AMG145 every two weeks, 60% in the 105 mg group and 66% in the 140 mg group. When the drug was administered every two weeks, the mean reduction in LDL was 42% for the 280 mg group, 50% for the 350 mg group and 50% in the 420 mg group. The most common side effects seen in the Amgen trial of statin patients were cold-like symptoms, cough and nausea. Side effects in previous, smaller, trials of the drug included injection-site reactions, headache and muscle pain. AMG145 has demonstrated "very effective lipid changes," said Dr. Peter Wilson, an endocrinologist at Emory University and the Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta.Â
