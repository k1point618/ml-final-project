NK Rosneft' OAO, Exxon Mobil Corporation To Sign Strategic Deal-Reuters
Monday, 16 Apr 2012 07:07am EDT
Reuters reported that NK Rosneft' OAO and Exxon Mobil Corporation will sign a wide-ranging strategic partnership at Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's residence. The deal will grant Rosneft access to projects in North America, where Exxon is developing hard-to-recover reserves in West Texas, the Canadian province of Alberta and in the Gulf of Mexico. The two companies will also seek to transfer know-how from those projects to develop Rosneft's own vast reserves of so-called 'tight' oil held in non-porous rock in Western Siberia.Â
