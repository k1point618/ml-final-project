Reuters reported that General Motors Co said that it is recalling 4,304 Chevrolet Malibu Eco cars sold in the United States to reprogram a module that controls airbag deployments. The U.S. automaker said in what it described as rare cases under extremely aggressive turning, the roof rail airbags in some 2013 model year Malibu Ecos might inflate. It also said in another scenario it described as rarer that the airbags and safety belt pretensioners might not deploy. General Motors Co said no crashes or injuries have been reported related to this issue. General Motors Co said it discovered the problem during a development test in which one of the cars was performing extreme maneuvers.Â
