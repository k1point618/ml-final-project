Ford Motor Co Sues Dana Holding Corp Over Part Linked To Windstar Recall-Reuters
Wednesday, 1 Aug 2012 07:01pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co has sued Dana Holding Corp, one of its suppliers, over a part linked to the recall last year of more than 425,000 Ford Windstar minivans. In a July 27, 2012 complaint filed in a Wayne County, Michigan state court, Ford said Dana has refused to accept responsibility for the inadequate subframes it had supplied for Windstars made during the 1999 to 2003 model years. Ford said it has suffered substantial damages from the subframes and the recall, but that Dana has refused to cover its costs. The lawsuit seeks compensation for past and future damages related to the subframes, as well as other costs. A spokesman for Dana, which is based in Maumee, Ohio, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On January 26, 2011, Ford recalled 425,288 Windstars in 22 mostly cold-weather U.S. states plus the District of Columbia, saying that subframe brackets and mounts might separate, causing a loss of steering control and a greater risk of a crash. The recall followed a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into dozens of reports of subframe problems, nearly all from what it called Salt Belt states. Ford is asking the court to enforce the cost sharing terms of the supply agreement with Dana, said Todd Nissen, a spokesman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.Â
