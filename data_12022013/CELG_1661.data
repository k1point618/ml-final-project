Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sarl Presents Results of Study into Use of ABRAXANE (nab-paclitaxel) Combined with Gemcitabine in the Treatment of Resectable Pancreatic Cancer

Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sarl announced its results from a study of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. These results were reported during the 48th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. In the study, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were treated with nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 days 1,8 and 15) for two cycles prior to surgery. Response was assessed by FDG-PET scan, CA19.9 levels and elastography. Of 16 patients enrolled, 12 have received operations and 11 achieved a complete resection. Based on CT scan assessment, of the 16 enrolled patients, 3 had progressive disease while 13 achieved stable disease or partial response. The median value for PET SUVmax decreased from 7.2 pre-treatment to 4.5 post-treatment (p=0.005), including 8 patients with a partial metabolic response. Mean CA19.9 level decreased from 2588 to 1056 (p=0.001) with 50% of patients experiencing at least a 70% decrease in tumor marker level. Additionally, the elastography ratio value diminished from 36 pre-treatment to 18 post-treatment (p=0.002) and correlated with improvement in SUVmax (p=0.494) and CA19.9 response (p=0.019). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the addition of nab-paclitaxel alters the collagen structure surrounding pancreatic tumors.Â
