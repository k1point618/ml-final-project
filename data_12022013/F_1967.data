Ford Motor Co Sued Over F-150 Fuel Injection System-Reuters
Thursday, 30 Aug 2012 02:02pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co has been sued for allegedly infringing a patent that covers a fuel-injection system it uses in its F-150 truck. According to a federal complaint made public on August 30, 2012, TMC Fuel Injection System LLC of Wayne, Pennsylvania, is the assignee and owner of the January 2008 patent, which covers a fuel flow process that improves fuel economy, cuts exhaust emissions and reduces idle speed. TMC said that in August 2008, Ford decided against licensing the technology but has been incorporating it in vehicles, including the F-150. TMC filed its case with the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.Â
