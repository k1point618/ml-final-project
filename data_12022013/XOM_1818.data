NK Rosneft' OAO in talks to join Exxon Mobil Corp in Iraq-Reuters
Friday, 22 Jun 2012 01:29am EDT
Reuters reported that NK Rosneft' OAO has been in talks with Exxon Mobil Corp over the possibility of teaming up with the American company to tap Iraq's huge West Qurna-1 oilfield, Kommersant daily reported. The daily, citing, said Rosneft may secure 20% in the project operated by Exxon in southern Iraq. West Qurna-1, an 8.7 billion-barrel field in southern Iraq, is producing 406,000 barrels per day, which is expected to rise by 100,000 bpd later this year, an Iraqi oil official said in April, as the country looks to double output over the next three years during its recovery after years of sanctions and war. Sources at Rosneft also confirmed to Reuters that the Company had been in talks with Exxon over Iraq but declined to elaborate. Kommersant said the talks could be wrapped up within a month. Spokesmen for Rosneft and Exxon were not immediately available to comment.Â
