FERC Extends Time To Consider Rehearing In JPMorgan Chase & Co-Reuters
Monday, 14 Jan 2013 03:59pm EST
Reuters reported that U.S. federal energy regulators on Monday extended the amount of time available to decide if they will grant a rehearing against JPMorgan Chase & Co that would temporarily suspend the bank's energy desk from trading in a segment of the power market. In November, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase & Co's J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp energy arm from trading power at market-based rates for six months, starting in April, for failing to disclose information in a market manipulation investigation. FERC has not accused the U.S. bank of market manipulation. JPMorgan has said it would fight the sanction. Market-based rate authority allows a company to trade power at whatever price the market will bear.Â
