Hach Rose Schirripa & Cheverie, LLP and Law Offices of Jay Saltzman, P.C. Initiate Securities Lawsuit Against Facebook Inc
Wednesday, 30 May 2012 07:14pm EDT
Hach Rose Schirripa & Cheverie, LLP and the Law Offices of Jay Saltzman, P.C. announced that it has filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook Inc, its officers and underwriters in federal court in the Southern District of New York on behalf all persons who purchased Facebook common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's May 18, 2012 initial public offering (the IPO). The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to publicly disclose that Facebook was experiencing a severe reduction in earnings growth and that, during the IPO roadshow, the Company advised the underwriters' analysts to materially lower their earnings forecasts for 2012. Accordingly, each of the lead underwriters internally reduced its second quarter and full year 2012 earnings estimates for Facebook and then selectively disclosed this information to certain large institutional investors -- without revising the Registration Statement and/or Prospectus. Facebook's underwriters then advised certain of their major clients to reduce their requests for allocations of the Company's shares. Despite this adverse material non-public information, the lead underwriters increased to the highest end of the proposed range the Company's share price and increased by 25% the number of shares sold in the offering.Â
