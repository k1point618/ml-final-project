Friday, 25 May 2012 09:15am EDT
The law firm of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP is investigating the wrongdoing alleged in shareholder actions brought against JPMorgan Chase & Co. and/or officers and directors arising from the Company’s recent multi-billion dollar trading loss. On May 10, 2012, JPMorgan filed Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and disclosed that plan to hedge risks has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than the firm previously believed.
