Google Inc Says Apple Inc Patent Lawsuit Dismissed-Reuters
Monday, 5 Nov 2012 02:35pm EST
Reuters reported that A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit by Apple Inc alleging that Google Inc owned Motorola's patent licensing practices were unfair, Google said. Apple had been set to square off against Motorola on November 5, 2012 in a trial in U.S. District Court in Madison, Wisconsin, involving Google’s use of the library of patents it acquired along with Motorola for $12.5 billion in May. Dismissal of a case with prejudice means the case is over at the trial court level, though it can be appealed. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
