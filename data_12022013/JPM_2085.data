JPMorgan Chase & Co Must pay $18 Million In Trust Mismanagement Case-Reuters
Wednesday, 10 Oct 2012 03:02pm EDT
Reuters reported that A U.S. state court has ordered JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N to pay more than $18 million to a trust in a suit stemming from the bank's recommendation of a type of complex security that was unsuitable for the trust and benefited the bank. P Morgan and the trust entered into numerous variable prepaid forward contracts between 2000 and 2005. A court, in 2007, ordered the transfer of the trust's assets to another bank. The investment contracts between the trust and JP Morgan, by that time, had been settled.Â
