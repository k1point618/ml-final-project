Ford Motor Co Sues Fujikura Ltd-Reuters
Wednesday, 17 Jul 2013 07:39pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co has sued Fujikura Ltd, claiming a conspiracy to fix the prices of electrical systems used in vehicles, the latest civil lawsuit filed in the wake of a related criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. In its lawsuit, filed in Detroit federal court on Tuesday, Ford said that Fujikura and alleged co-conspirators agreed not to compete with one another to sell Ford wire harnesses. The lawsuit seeks three times the damages Ford suffered as a result of paying what it said were artificially high prices for the harnesses. An attorney for Ford declined to comment, as did Fujikura.Â
