CFTC Opens Probe Into JPMorgan Chase & Co. Trading Loss-Reuters
Friday, 18 May 2012 11:51pm EDT
Reuters reported that The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has opened an investigation into possible wrongdoing at JPMorgan Chase & Co in connection with the bank's multi-billion-dollar trading loss, a source familiar with the probe told Reuters. The agency will soon disclose the existence of the investigation, the source said on Friday. Earlier on Friday, the New York Times reported that the CFTC had opened an enforcement case, quoting people briefed on the matter. The CFTC would join the FBI and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission among federal agencies examining the loss, which the largest U.S. bank said last week was at least $2 billion. The CFTC has disclosed an investigation into last October's collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd, a futures and commodities brokerage from where large sums of customer money remain missing. The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, and the newspaper said all of the investigations into its trading loss are preliminary. CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler is expected to reveal his agency's investigation when he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, the newspaper said. The CFTC began tracking JPMorgan's trading in April, the newspaper said, when reports surfaced that London-based trader Bruno Iksil was taking big bets in credit derivatives. Its probe may examine whether the bank's trading affected that market, the newspaper said.Â
