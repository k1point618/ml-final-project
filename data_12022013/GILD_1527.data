Gilead Sciences, Inc. Announces Data For Genotype 1 Null Responder Hepatitis C Patients Enrolled In ELECTRON Study
Friday, 17 Feb 2012 06:01am EST
Gilead Sciences, Inc. announced that the majority of hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with a prior null response to an interferon (IFN)-containing regimen enrolled in the ongoing ELECTRON study experienced viral relapse within four weeks of completing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 plus ribavirin (RBV). Ten patients were randomized to this arm of the ELECTRON study and data are available for eight of the 10 patients at this time. Among these eight patients, six have experienced viral relapse. Two patients have not relapsed; however, they have only reached the two week post-treatment time point. GS-7977 is a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor that is currently being studied for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. A number of ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the compound with and without RBV and/or pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) in patients with genotypes 1-6 who are treatment naïve, treatment experienced, or have had a null response to Peg-IFN.
