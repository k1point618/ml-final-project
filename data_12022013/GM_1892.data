General Motors Co's GM Korea, Union Reach Tentative Wage Deal-Reuters
Monday, 13 Aug 2012 09:33pm EDT
Reuters reported that the South Korean unit of General Motors Co has reached a tentative wage agreement with its labour union, casting the spotlight next on other South Korean carmakers such as Hyundai Motor and whether they will follow suit. GM Korea's union executives will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to approve the tentative deal, which may be put to a union vote on Thursday and Friday. The agreement came after factory workers at GM Korea staged a series of partial strikes in July and August, and includes a basic salary increase of 80,564 Korean won ($71.23), a bonus of 5 million won and a one-off payment of 3 million won, among others.Â
