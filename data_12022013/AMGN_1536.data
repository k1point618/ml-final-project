Amgen Inc Announces Evolocumab (AMG 145) Results From First 52-Week Study Of A PCSK9 Inhibitor To Reduce LDL Cholesterol
Tuesday, 19 Nov 2013 05:32pm EST
Amgen Inc announced results from the Open Label Study of Long TERm Evaluation Against LDL-C (OSLER) trial, a long-term controlled 52-week safety and efficacy study, that showed monthly treatment with evolocumab (AMG 145), an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits PCSK9, a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or "bad" cholesterol, from the blood1, was not associated with a major increase in adverse events (AEs) versus standard of care (SOC) and produced mean LDL-C reductions of 52% in combination with SOC in patients with high cholesterol. OSLER is an ongoing open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of evolocumab in patients with high cholesterol. In the first year, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive evolocumab and SOC or SOC alone. In the OSLER clinical trial, subcutaneous monthly treatment with evolocumab in combination with SOC resulted in a significant LDL-C decrease versus SOC alone in patients who previously completed one of four 12-week Phase 2 studies of evolocumab. After 52 weeks of treatment, patients who first received evolocumab in the OSLER study experienced an average of 52 percent reduction in LDL-C, as measured by the accepted standard preparative ultracentrifugation compared to baseline of the Phase 2 parent study.Â
