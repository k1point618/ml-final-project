SeeNews - The Corporate Wire reported that the shares of Apple Inc, Visa Inc, Intel Corp, The Coca-Cola Company and Bank of America Corp can be traded on the Bucharest bourse as of April 18, 2012. The Romanian brokerage Tradeville will act as market maker for the five companies. Tradeville plans to transfer some of the liquidity from the main market of these shares to the Bucharest bourse. It will be started with an initial portfolio of EUR 250,000 (USD 327,125), which will be adjusted according to the market demand. Tradeville started preparing to offer local investors shares in the five companies after the Romanian capital market regulator, CNVM, allowed companies from non-European Union states to trade on the Alternative Trading System of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.Â
