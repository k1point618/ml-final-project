New York To Sue Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp Over Mortgage Practices-Reuters
Monday, 6 May 2013 06:22pm EDT
Reuters reported that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said, he plans to sue Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo and Co for violating the terms of a settlement designed to end mortgage servicing abuses. The planned action is the first involving allegations that top banks, which agreed last year to provide $25 billion in relief to homeowners and comply with a set of servicing standards to atone for foreclosure misconduct, are not living up to their obligations under the deal. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America said in a statement that it takes seriously the allegations of servicing problems and will work quickly to address them.Â
