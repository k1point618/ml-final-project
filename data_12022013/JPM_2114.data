U.S. Regulator Says Looking At JPMorgan Chase & Co. Clawbacks-Reuters
Tuesday, 5 Jun 2012 07:11pm EDT
Reuters reported that U.S. bank regulators will review whether JPMorgan Chase & Co. executives should have to give back compensation due to the bank's failed hedging strategy that has produced at least $2 billion in losses. Agency will evaluate the compensation of the Chief Investment Office responsible for the trading loss, and will assess JPMorgan's determination on clawbacks as part of that evaluation. JPMorgan's trading loss will affect its earnings but does not present a solvency issue and does not threaten the broader financial system. JPMorgan announced the losses last month, rattling Wall Street and Washington and raising questions about whether banks are still taking too many risks following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.Â
