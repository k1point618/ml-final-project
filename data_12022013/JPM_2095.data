Judge OKs JPMorgan Chase & Co $100 Million Credit Card Settlement-Reuters
Friday, 10 Aug 2012 02:52pm EDT
Reuter reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co won a federal judge's preliminary approval of a $100 million class-action settlement with credit card customers who accused the bank of improperly trying to generate higher fees by boosting their minimum payments. The settlement resolves claims over Chase's decision in late 2008 and 2009 to boost minimum monthly payments for thousands of cardholders to 5% of account balances from 2%. Cardholders said Chase had induced them to transfer loan balances from other lenders to Chase card accounts, where the debt would be consolidated into fixed-rate loans. U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco on Thursday granted preliminary approval to the settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.Â
