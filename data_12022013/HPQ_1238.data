Hewlett-Packard Co's HP Enterprise Services Selected By P&G To Help Improve Supply-chain Efficiency, Speed Products To Market
Monday, 5 Nov 2012 07:45am EST
Hewlett-Packard Co's HP Enterprise Services announced that Procter & Gamble (P&G) has selected HP application support to power its Always On operating environment, enabling P&G to reach a greater number of consumers in more meaningful ways. The applications agreement follows a recently announced infrastructure technology services agreement. HP has supported P&G's infrastructure and applications environments, as well as many business processes, for more than nine years. Under the terms of the new agreement, HP will be accountable for most of the critical business applications used throughout P&G's financial and supply-chain systems, including research and development, inventory management, SAP enterprise resource planning, and business intelligence. HP will integrate P&G systems -- including those provided by other vendors -- by supporting applications, databases, servers and networks to create a more standard, reliable and transparent technology environment. As a result, P&G expects to enhance the quality and efficiency of its product supply chain, as well as its ability to be innovative -- all while reducing overall operating costs.Â
