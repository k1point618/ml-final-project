FBI Launches JPMorgan Chase & Co. Probe-Reuters
Tuesday, 15 May 2012 07:18pm EDT
Reuters reported that The FBI has opened an inquiry into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at JPMorgan Chase, stepping up pressure on the bank after key U.S. agencies said they were looking into high-risk trades that first drew regulators' attention last month. A source familiar with the situation said that U.S. and UK regulators first raised concerns with senior management in April. A separate source familiar with the FBI probe, opened by the agency's New York office, described it as preliminary. The bank's trading losses have also drawn the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, both of which have opened inquiries.Â
