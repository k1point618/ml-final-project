UK Auto Workers Protest Severance Packages Offered By Ford Motor Co At Dagenham Plant-DJ
Thursday, 18 Apr 2013 09:26am EDT
Dow Jones reported that U.K. labor union Unite said that workers at Ford Motor Co .'s plant are voting over severance packages and alternative jobs being offered by the U.S. giant which is closing the metal stamping and tool facility. Ford has offered to redeploy the 750 workers affected at the plant in Dagenham near London but suitable alternative jobs haven't been made available especially for some 100 skilled toolmakers. The closure is part of the Dearborn, Michigan-based company's plans to cut operating costs in Europe by $500 million over the next two years by closing three plants, including one in Genk, Belgium, cutting 6,200 jobs and reducing the ability to make vehicles by 18% in the region.Â
