General Motors Co and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA Create Global Alliance; Joint Venture to Be Formed
Wednesday, 29 Feb 2012 01:00pm EST
General Motors Co and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA announced the creation of a long-term and broad-scale global strategic alliance. The alliance is structured around two main pillars: the sharing of vehicle platforms, components and modules; and the creation of a global purchasing joint venture for the sourcing of commodities, components and other goods and services from suppliers. Under the terms of the agreement, General Motors Co and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA will share selected platforms, modules and components on a worldwide basis, in order to achieve cost savings, gain efficiencies, leverage volumes and advanced technologies, and reduce emissions. Initially, General Motors Co and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA intend to focus on small and midsize passenger cars, MPVs and crossovers. The companies will also consider developing a new common platform for low emission vehicles. The first vehicle on a common platform is expected to launch by 2016. Additionally, the alliance is exploring areas for further cooperation, such as integrated logistics and transportation. To this end, General Motors Co intends to establish a strategic, commercial cooperation with Gefco, an integrated logistics services company and subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen SA, whereby Gefco would provide logistics services to General Motors Co in Europe and Russia.Â
