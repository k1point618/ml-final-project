Friday, 19 Oct 2012 02:45am EDT
Dow Jones reported that PTT Exploration and Production PCL will take a 15% stake in a consortium that is developing Indonesia's massive East Natuna gas block. PTT EP's stake would replace that of Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which pulled out of a Pertamina-led consortium to develop the offshore block earlier this year. Pertamina has signed a new partnership agreement with PTT EP, leaving Pertamina with a 35% stake, Exxon Mobil Corporation with 35% and TOTAL S.A. with 15%.Â
