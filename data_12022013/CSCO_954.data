Wednesday, 13 Feb 2013 04:30pm EST
Cisco Systems Inc announced that for the third quarter of 2013, it expects revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. This assumes that the Company's divestiture of the Linksys product line, which has been approximately 1% of its product revenue closes mid quarter and will no longer be contributing to its top line. The Company's third quarter 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.48 to $0.50 per share (EPS) and anticipate GAAP earnings in third quarter 2013 to be $0.08 to $0.11 per share lower than its non-GAAP EPS. The Company reported revenue of $11.588 billion in the third quarter of 2012. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts on an average are expecting the Company to report revenue of $12.220 billion and EPS of $0.49 for the third quarter of 2013.Â
