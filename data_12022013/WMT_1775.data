Monday, 6 Feb 2012 07:00am EST
MacroSolve Inc announced that it has filed a patent infringement suit against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. for violation of MacroSolve's U.S. Patent No. 7,822,816. MacroSolve's lawsuit claims that Wal-Mart has infringed upon patent rights through actions including product and system referred to as Walmart mobile app. The suit further claims that, MacroSolve has been damaged as a result of the infringing conduct by defendant alleged above and, thus, such defendant is liable to MacroSolve in an amount that adequately compensates it for defendant's infringements, which, by law, cannot be less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs as fixed by this Court under 35 U.S.C. Section 284.Â
