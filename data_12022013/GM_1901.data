Stewarts Law US LLP Files Securities Class Action Lawsuit Against General Motors Co
Wednesday, 11 Jul 2012 07:00pm EDT
Stewarts Law US LLP announced it has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of General Motors Co pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s November 18, 2010 Initial Public Offering (the IPO), alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Complaint). The case is entitled Scott v. General Motors Co., et al., C.A. No. 1:12-CV-5124 (LTS) (S.D.N.Y.). The Complaint names GM, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and several underwriting investment banks as defendants and alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued by GM in connection with the IPO were false, misleading and in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Specifically, the Complaint alleges, in connection with the IPO, and in order to assuage concerns that GM was predicting revenue based on production rather than actual sales, GM falsely assured investors that it was actively managing its production by monitoring its dealer inventory levels. Additionally, GM assured investors that in 2011 it would improve inventory management, which would improve average transaction price.
