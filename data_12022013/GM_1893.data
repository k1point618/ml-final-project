Monday, 13 Aug 2012 07:47am EDT
Reuters reported that General Motors Co is recalling more than 38,000 Chevrolet Impala police cars in North America because the lower front control arms could fracture, increasing the risk of crash. The recall, which does not affect non-police versions of the Impala, covers 36,413 cars in the United States and 1,713 in Canada, according to GM and documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It covers cars from the 2008 to 2012 model years. GM said there had been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the issue.Â
