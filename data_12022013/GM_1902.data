Thursday, 5 Jul 2012 05:08am EDT
Dow Jones reported that General Motors Co's South Korean unit will stage industrial action on three days next week after wage talks with the company broke down, the union's spokesman said on Thursday. They will hold a partial strike for six hours a day on July 10 and July 12 and eight hours on July 13. The decision comes after the 12th round of wage negotiations broke down. They are demanding to have a monthly salary increase of 151,696 won (USD133), a permanent transition to a two-shift work system, and bonuses equivalent to five months of wages.Â
