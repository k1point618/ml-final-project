JPMorgan Chase & Co's One Equity Partners Seeks To Sell Constantia Flexibles Stake-Reuters
Tuesday, 15 Oct 2013 01:03pm EDT
Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co's One Equity Partners (OEP) is seeking to sell its majority stake in Austrian packaging group Constantia Flexibles either through a stock market listing or a trade sale, three people familiar with the matter said. While a flotation in Frankfurt remains the preferred option for OEP, and could take place this year or early in 2014, the private equity firm is also keeping the door open for potential buyers, the three people familiar with the matter said on October 15, 2013. OEP beat CVC in an auction to buy Constantia Flexibles in 2009. OEP owns 75% of Constantia Flexibles, with the founding family's foundation holding the rest. While OEP could divest all of its stake in a trade sale, it is unlikely to be able to do so in a listing. Between 30% and 50% of the Company would be floated on the stock market.Â
