General Motors Co Postpones Brazil Layoffs Decision Until November-Reuters
Sunday, 5 Aug 2012 01:31pm EDT
Reuters reported that General Motors Co and a Brazilian union have agreed to postpone until November a politically sensitive decision to eliminate as many as 1,840 jobs at a factory near São Paulo. The decision, following tense talks and heated reminders by Brazil's government that current tax cuts enjoyed by the carmaker go hand in hand with a pledge to preserve jobs, gives GM an additional three months to decide about layoffs on an assembly line it says it no longer needs. The government has warned GM against cutting jobs, especially because sales, which had slowed due to a sluggish Brazilian economy, in recent months have rebounded with government tax breaks. Of the workers at risk of losing their jobs, GM will keep 900 on the assembly line, the company said. The rest will continue receiving their salaries as they undergo training for other jobs.
