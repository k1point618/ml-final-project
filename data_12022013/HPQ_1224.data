Hewlett-Packard Co's Autonomy announced that the State of Oregon has selected HP TRIM as the cornerstone of a cloud-based records management system that will allow state, city and county agencies to manage, secure and provide access to digital and physical documents. The pilot program originated in the office of the Oregon Secretary of State , which used HP TRIM to manage its digital and physical records. Before using HP TRIM, employees had to go through back-up tapes, emails and file servers to satisfy public records requests.Â
