SEC Looking At JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Financial Reporting-Reuters
Tuesday, 22 May 2012 06:50pm EDT
Reuters reported that the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told lawmakers on Tuesday that her agency is probing JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s financial reporting and emphasized that big banks are required to publicly disclose changes to the models they use to measure risk. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro assured the Senate Banking Committee that the SEC is investigating JPMorgan's revelation earlier this month that it suffered at least $2 billion in losses on complex trades that started as hedges but morphed into a risky bet. The SEC will be primarily interested in and focused on the appropriateness and completeness of the entity's financial reporting, Schapiro said. She also addressed reports that JPMorgan changed its value-at-risk (VaR) model, an estimate of losses that could occur on a particular trade or portfolio of trades, in a way that allowed the trading portfolio in question to appear safer than it actually was and gave traders more leeway to make risky bets. "When there are changes to the VaR model - as newspapers have reported was done at JPMorgan; they changed their VaR model - those changes have to be disclosed," Schapiro said. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon first announced that the unit responsible for the trades had changed its VaR model when he announced the trading losses on May 10. Schapiro did not elaborate on whether this change is a specific focus of the SEC inquiry into JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets.Â
