Reuters reported that A federal judge has dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, of conspiring to fix automated teller machine fees. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., said that, while the three lawsuits bristle with indignation, the plaintiffs failed to show they were injured, or that there was a conspiracy to charge excessive or artificially high fees. The plaintiffs included several individual consumers, 13 owners and operators of independent non-bank ATMs that compete with bank ATMs, as well as the National ATM Council, a trade group for those owners and operators. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Â
