Google Inc. Proposes Android Revenue For Oracle Corporation-Filing-Reuters
Wednesday, 28 Mar 2012 01:20pm EDT
Reuters reported that Google proposed to pay Oracle a percentage of Android revenue if Oracle could prove patent infringement of the mobile operating technology at an upcoming trial, but Oracle rebuffed the offer as too low, according to a court filing late on Tuesday. Oracle Corporation sued Google Inc. in 2010, claiming the company's Android technology infringed Oracle's Java patents. A trial is set for April 16 before U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco. Oracle also sued for alleged copyright infringement. Oracle has contended that Google should pay hundreds of millions of dollars on that claim, which is separate from the patents. In response, Google proposed a deal: if Oracle succeeded in proving patent infringement, Google would not spend time fighting about damages if Oracle agreed to its figures. Google offered to pay Oracle roughly $2.8 million in damages on the two patents remaining in the case, covering the period through 2011.Â
