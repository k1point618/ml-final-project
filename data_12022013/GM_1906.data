Ryan & Maniskas, LLP Announces Investigation Of General Motors Co
Friday, 22 Jun 2012 07:00pm EDT
Ryan & Maniskas, LLP announced that it has commenced an investigation into potential securities law violations by certain officers of General Motors Company and several underwriting investment banks for possible violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the Company’s November 18, 2010 Initial Public Offering (the IPO). The investigation surrounds the allegation that the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued by GM in connection with the IPO were false, misleading and in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 by falsely reassuring investors that GM was actively managing their production levels through monitoring of dealer inventory. In addition, GM assured investors that in 2011, it would improve inventory management, which would improve average transaction price. A July 5, 2011 article published by Bloomberg revealed that GM may have been stuffing its channels with excess inventory. The article stated that its truck inventory had ballooned to an average of 122 days worth of average sales compared to 60 to 70 days for most other models. Indeed, GM had to close two U.S. pickup truck plants for two weeks in July 2011 as sales of pickups begin to wane and trucks are backlogged on dealer lots. In the three months following the article, GM’s share price fell from more than $31.00 to below $20.00, far below the IPO price of $33.00.
