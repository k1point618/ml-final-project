VMware Inc Announces Authorization of Stock Repurchase Program
Wednesday, 7 Aug 2013 04:01pm EDT
VMware Inc announced that Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to $700 million of its Class A common stock through the end of 2015. Stock will be purchased from time to time, in the open market or through private transactions, subject to market conditions. The Company expects the equity purchase program to help partially offset dilution from its equity programs. The new stock repurchase authorization is in addition to the Company's ongoing $250 million stock repurchase program, originally announced November 29, 2012.Â
