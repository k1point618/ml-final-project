Ford Motor Co Recalls 7,150 Newly Built Vehicles To Repair Child Locks-Reuters
Tuesday, 12 Mar 2013 10:45am EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co will recall 7,150 vehicles built in November 2012, including the 2013 Escape crossover, because some models are equipped with a defective child lock on the left rear door. Also included in the recall are the 2013 Focus and C-Max cars, the second-largest U.S. automaker said. The company will inspect 5,638 Escapes that were built in Louisville Assembly Plant between November 14, 2012 and November 24, 2012, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in an email. In some of these vehicles, the child lock on the left rear door may not work when the driver tries to activate the locks. The driver may incorrectly believe that the locks are functioning properly, Ford said.Â
