Amgen Inc Announces Pooled Analysis Showing AMG 145 Significantly Reduced LDL Cholesterol In Over 1,200 Patients
Sunday, 1 Sep 2013 04:51am EDT
Amgen Inc announced treatment with AMG 145 resulted in significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or 'bad' cholesterol, of up to 59% in an efficacy analysis of pooled data from four 12-week Phase 2 studies evaluating AMG 145 in patient populations with high cholesterol. AMG 145 is an investigational human monoclonal antibody that inhibits PCSK9, a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL-C from the blood. Amgen presented the data at the ESC Congress 2013, organized by the European Society of Cardiology, in Amsterdam. Elevated LDL-C is recognized as a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease.Despite the availability of various treatments to lower LDL-C, it is estimated that in two-thirds of treated, high-risk patients, LDL-C is not well-controlled. Results from the efficacy analysis showed mean reductions in LDL-C from baseline to week 12, as measured by preparative ultracentrifugation, ranged from 40% to 59% across AMG 145 doses in comparison to 0.1% to 0.5% for placebo (p=0.001). AMG 145 treatment was also associated with improvements in other lipid parameters, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein A1, within each targeted dose frequency of AMG 145.Â
