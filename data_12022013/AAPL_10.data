VirnetX Holding Corp Announces Apple Inc Files To Appeal $368 Million Award In Patent Case-DJ
Monday, 1 Jul 2013 07:40pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that VirnetX Holding Corp said Apple Inc. has filed to appeal a $368 million award the Internet security firm was granted by a jury in February in a patent infringement case. In February, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a $368 million final judgment against Apple after finding that four of VirnetX's patents were infringed and valid. The district court last month denied a motion filed by Apple to alter or amend the judgment. Apple has now appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A federal court in February upheld VirnetX's $368 million award in a patent suit against Apple, but Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) prevailed in a separate suit in March that accused the networking company of violating one of VirnetX's patents by selling routers designed to run virtual private networks.Â
