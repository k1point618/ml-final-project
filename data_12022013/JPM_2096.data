JPMorgan Chase & Co. In $100 Million Credit Card Settlement-Reuters
Tuesday, 24 Jul 2012 12:23pm EDT
Reuter reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $100 million to settle litigation by credit card customers who accused the U.S. bank of improperly boosting their minimum payments as a means to generate higher fees. The class-action settlement resolves a three-year-old case stemming from Chase's decision in late 2008 and 2009 to boost minimum monthly payments for thousands of cardholders to 5% of account balances from 2%. Cardholders claimed that JPMorgan had induced them to transfer balances from other lenders to Chase card accounts, where the bank would consolidate their debt into loans with fixed interest rates until balances were paid off. In a July 23, 2012 filing with the federal court in San Francisco, lawyers for the cardholders said the $100 million is 45% of the $220 million in up-front transaction fees that their clients paid for the promotional loans.Â
