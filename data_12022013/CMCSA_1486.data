Sprint Nextel Corp In Talks With Intel Corp And Comcast Corp To Buy Stake In Clearwire Corp-Reuters
Tuesday, 11 Dec 2012 06:44pm EST
Reuters reported that Sprint Nextel Corp is in talks with Intel Corp and Comcast Corp to buy out their stakes in the U.S. wireless provider Clearwire Corp. The cellular company, which owns just over 50% in Clearwire, would still need buy out the rest of the minority shareholders in Clearwire to gain full ownership. Intel and Comcast own a combined basis roughly 12.4% of Clearwire's total shares outstanding, including publicly traded stock and Class B shares, according to a Clearwire filing. Sprint, Clearwire, Intel and Comcast all declined to comment.Â
