Carl Icahn Pulls Offer For Rest Of CVR Energy Inc; Names Valero Energy Corp. And Other As Possible Buyers-Reuters
Tuesday, 21 Aug 2012 05:32pm EDT
Reuters reported that Carl Icahn has withdrawn his $29-per-share offer to buy the remaining shares of CVR Energy Inc that he does not already own. Icahn, who controls about 82% of CVR's outstanding shares, acknowledged in a letter to CVR filed with securities regulators that he had been unwilling to consider paying more than $30 per share as of August 6. Icahn, who got control of CVR through a $30 per share tender offer, earlier tried to find a buyer for CVR, insisting he would not settle for an offer below $35 per share in cash. He had named Valero Energy Corp., Western Refining, Inc., HollyFrontier Corp, Tesoro Corp , and Marathon Petroleum Corporation as possible buyers.Â
