Comcast Corp To Acquire General Electric's 49% Common Equity Ownership Interest In NBCUniversal
Tuesday, 12 Feb 2013 04:30pm EST
Comcast Corp announced that it will acquire GE's entire 49% common equity stake in the NBCUniversal joint venture for approximately $16.7 billion. Also, NBCUniversal will purchase from GE the properties used by NBCUniversal at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and CNBC`s headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ for approximately $1.4 billion. The acquisition accelerates GE's divestiture ahead of a redemption period that would have begun in July 2014 and solidifies Comcast`s position as a media and technology company. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of this year. The transactions will be funded with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4.0 billion of subsidiary senior unsecured notes to be issued to GE, $2.0 billion of borrowings under Comcast and/or subsidiary bank credit facilities and $725 million of subsidiary preferred stock to be issued to GE. Morgan Stanley was financial advisor to Comcast and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP was the Company`s legal advisor.Â
