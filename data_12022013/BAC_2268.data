Law Firm of Klayman & Toskes Continues To InvestigateBank Of America Corporation
Thursday, 15 Mar 2012 06:10pm EDT
Law Firm of Klayman & Toskes announced that it is continuing to investigate claims against Merrill Lynch, a part of Bank of America, on behalf of customers of Phil Scott a/k/a Walter Schlaepfer, and the Phil Scott Team. K&T has been retained by former clients of Phil Scott, and is preparing to file securities arbitration claims against Merrill Lynch on their behalf in an effort to recover their investment losses. The Claimants in these cases alleged that Phil Scott made unsuitable recommendations to place their assets in the Merrill Lynch Phil Scott Team Income Portfolios which were invested in 100% equities. To make matters worse, one of the Claimants had 60% of the portfolio pledged to three different Merrill Lynch loans. This only increased the risk associated with their portfolio and led to the forced liquidation of securities when the market value of the account declined.Â
