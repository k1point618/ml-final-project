Gilead Sciences Inc Announces 100% Sustained Virologic Response Rate for Interferon-Free Regimen of Sofosbuvir, GS-5885 and Ribavirin in Treatment-Naïve Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Infected Patients
Saturday, 10 Nov 2012 09:02am EST
Gilead Sciences Inc announced interim data from the ongoing Phase 2 ELECTRON study examining a 12-week course of therapy with the investigational nucleotide sofosbuvir (formerly referred to as GS-7977), the NS5A inhibitor GS-5885 and ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Among treatment-naïve patients receiving this combination, 100% (n=25/25) remained HCV RNA undetectable four weeks after completing therapy (SVR4). Gilead recently initiated the first Phase 3 trial (ION-I) evaluating a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and GS-5885 in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients. This four-arm study is evaluating the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin for 12-and 24-week durations in 800 patients, 20% of whom have evidence of cirrhosis. Preliminary data from a subset of an ongoing cohort in the ELECTRON study in which nine genotype 1 previous null responders were treated with sofosbuvir, GS-5885 and ribavirin for 12 weeks also will be presented on Tuesday. Thus far, three of the nine patients have reached the four-week post-treatment time point and all three remain HCV negative.
