Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Announces Investigation Of Potential Securities Fraud At General Motors Co
Friday, 13 Jul 2012 08:00pm EDT
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a national securities law firm, announced that it is investigating potential securities fraud at General Motors Co. The investigation focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) GM was predicting revenue based on production rather than actual sales; (2) the Company falsely assured investors that it was actively managing its production by monitoring its dealer inventory levels; and (3) the Company assured investors that its inventory management would improve in 2011, which would improve average transaction price. In July 2011, reports began to surface that GM had engaged in an extraordinary inventory build-up. In particular, an article published by Bloomberg on July 5, 2011 revealed that GM may have been unloading excessive inventory on dealers, a practice known as 'channel stuffing', in order to create the false impression that GM was recovering and sales and revenues were rising. By November 2011, GM dealer inventories were 30% higher than they were on September 30, 2010 (the end of the last full quarter before the November 18, 2010 IPO) and 62% higher than they were at the end of 2009.Â
