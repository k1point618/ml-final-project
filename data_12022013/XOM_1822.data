Iraq Excludes Exxon Mobil Corp From May Energy Auction-AP
Thursday, 19 Apr 2012 04:45am EDT
The Associated Press reported that Iraq's oil ministry says the Exxon Mobil Corp is not allowed to bid in the May energy auction because of its oil deals with the self-ruled Kurdish region in Iraq. Deputy head of the Oil Ministry's Licensing and Petroleum Contracts Department, Sabah al-Saidi, says the reason for the move is Exxon's refusal to abandon its controversial deals with Kurds. The Texas-based Exxon signed six deal with the Kurds last October to search for oil in six areas, bypassing the Baghdad government, which maintains that it must ratify all deals. Iraq is planning to auction off 12 exploration blocks nationwide. The bidding round is slated at the end of May.Â
