Amgen Inc Announces Results Of Phase 3 EVOLVE Trial
Saturday, 3 Nov 2012 03:37pm EDT
Amgen Inc announced results of the Phase 3 EVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) trial, which evaluated treatment with Sensipar/Mimpara (cinacalcet) for the reduction of the risk of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events among 3,883 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving dialysis. The primary endpoint of the study was time to the composite event comprising all-cause mortality or first non-fatal CV event, including myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure or peripheral vascular event. Although patients in the Sensipar/Mimpara arm experienced a 7% reduction in the primary endpoint (Hazard Ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02, p=0.112), the results were not statistically significant, and the trial did not meet primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics between the Sensipar/Mimpara and placebo groups were generally well-balanced with the notable exception of age - an important predictor of death and CV events.Â
