Bank of America Corporation Planning More Job Cuts-Reuters
Tuesday, 1 May 2012 12:04am EDT
Reuters reported that Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is planning to cut up to 400 jobs in its investment banking, corporate banking, and sales and trading units, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. An expected sale of the bank's non-U.S. wealth management operations in Asia, Latin America and Europe would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs, the Journal also said. Bank of America declined to comment on the Journal report. Last spring, the bank announced a cost cutting program called Project New BAC that aims to eliminate 30,000 consumer banking and technology jobs over the next few years. The bank has said it expects to wrap up plans for the second phase of the program, which focuses on investment banking, commercial banking and related support jobs, in May. The second phase is expected to cut fewer jobs than the first because it covers a smaller, more efficient part of the bank.Â
