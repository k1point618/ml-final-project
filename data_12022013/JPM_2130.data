Levi & Korsinsky announced that it is investigating potential claims on behalf of purchasers of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan or the Company)securities concerning possible breaches of fiduciary duty. In an SEC filing dated May 10, 2012, JPMorgan revealed that the company`s C.I.O. has had significant market-to-market-losses in its synthetic credit portfolio, and this portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than the firm previously believed. The Company also acknowledged that its Corporate unit could post an $800 million loss in the second quarter. In reaction to this news, JPMorgan stock plunged over 6% in after hours trading.Â
