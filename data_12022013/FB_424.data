Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP Commences Class Action Lawsuit On Behalf Of Investors In Facebook, Inc
Thursday, 24 May 2012 12:03pm EDT
Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP announced that they have filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on behalf of all persons who purchased the common stock of Facebook, Inc. pursuant or traceable to the Company’s May 18, 2012 initial public offering. In its May 18, 2012 IPO, Facebook floated over 421 million shares of its common stock to the public at a price of $38 per share on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol 'FB.' Under the terms of the offering, Facebook sold 180,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and selling stockholders sold 241,233,615 shares of Class A common stock. In total, the IPO raised $16 billion for the Company and the selling stockholders. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Facebook common stock pursuant or traceable to the Company’s IPO. This is a federal securities class action and is brought by Plaintiffs alleging claims under Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against Defendants. The Facebook IPO went public on May 18, 2012 at $38 per share, and only a few minutes later reached a high of $45 per share. On May 22, 2012, as reports of the materially lowered revenue estimates filtered out to the public through Reuters and other media outlets, the price of Facebook shares declined to close at only $31 per share.
