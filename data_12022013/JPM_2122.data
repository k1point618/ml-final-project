Finkelstein & Krinsk LLP Files Class Action Suit Against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Wednesday, 16 May 2012 03:16pm EDT
FINKELSTEIN & KRINSK LLP (Finkelstein & Krinsk) and MURRAY FRANK LLP announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan) common stock during the period between April 13, 2012 and May 10, 2012 (the Class Period). The case number is 1:12-cv-03879. The complaint alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) that occurred when the Defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the losses and risk of loss to the Company arising from massive bets on derivative contracts related to credit indexes reflecting interest rates on corporate bonds. These derivative bets went horribly wrong, resulting in billions of dollars in lost capital for the Company and billions more in lost market capitalization for JPMorgan shareholders. On May 10, 2012, JPMorgan filed an SEC Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, and after the market close, held a business update conference call with analysts and investors. Defendants revealed that the Company had experienced a slightly more than $2 billion trading loss under synthetic credit positions. As a result of this disclosure, the market price of JPMorgan's common stock fell from $40.74 per share at the market close on May 10, 2012, to $36.96 per share on May 11, 2012, falling more than 9% on extraordinary volume of 217 million shares.Â
