Telenor ASA Cooperates with Verizon Global Wholesale
Thursday, 12 Jan 2012 12:34pm EST
Telenor ASA announced that it has started collaboration with Verizon Global Wholesale to give Telenor's Nordic customers seamless access to a global network. Under a new agreement, Telenor will be able to resell Verizon Global Wholesale's international Private IP (Internet protocol) as part of Telenor's customer solution portfolio. Telenor customers will therefore have a single point of contact for their global communications needs, and access from Telenor's existing Nordic Connect area network to the rest of the globe. In addition, by linking into Verizon's multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) network, Telenor will also be able to offer its customers enhanced communications services on a global scale.Â
