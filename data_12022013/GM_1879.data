ABB Ltd and General Motors Co Demonstrate Chevrolet Volt Battery Reuse
Thursday, 15 Nov 2012 04:04am EST
ABB Ltd announced that the Company together with General Motors Co has demonstrated Chevrolet Volt Battery Reuse, the first use of electric vehicle batteries for homes which is capable of providing two hours of electricity needed by three to five average American homes. The uninterruptable power supply and grid power balancing system was demonstrated during General Motors' Electrification Experience. The prototype unit provided 25 kilowatt of power and 50 kilowatt hour of energy to power all the support lighting and audiovisual equipment in an 'off-grid' structure used for the event. During the demonstration, the energy storage system was run in a 'remote power back-up' mode where 100% of the power for the facility came from Volt batteries through the Company's Energy Storage Inverter system. A similar application could one day be used to power a group of homes or small commercial buildings during a power outage, allow for storage of power during inexpensive periods for use during expensive peak demand, or help make up for gaps in solar, wind or other renewable power generation. These functions, along with frequency regulation on electric distribution systems, could someday be used by utilities to reduce cost to customers and improve the quality of power delivery. These applications are referred to as community energy storage to distinguish them from substation-size energy storage projects.Â
