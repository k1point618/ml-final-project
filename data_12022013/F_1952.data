Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co is recalling about 230,000 older minivans globally to fix a corrosion problem that could prevent the fold-down third-row seats from locking in place. The recall affects 196,500 Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey minivans from model years 2004 through 2007 in the United States and another 33,500 in other countries, mostly Canada, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said. In the United States, the recall affects only vehicles sold or registered in 20 salt-belt states and the District of Columbia.Â
