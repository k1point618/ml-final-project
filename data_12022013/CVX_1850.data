Chevron Corp announced that its indirect Canadian subsidiary, Chevron Canada Limited, will acquire a 50% operating interest in the Kitimat liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and proposed Pacific Trail Pipeline (PTP), and a 50% interest in approximately 644,000 acres of petroleum and natural gas rights in the Horn River and Liard Basins in British Columbia, Canada. Under the terms of the agreements, Chevron Canada Limited will acquire all of the interests currently owned by affiliates of EOG Resources Canada Inc. and Encana Corporation in the proposed Kitimat LNG Project and PTP. Thereafter, Chevron Canada Limited will equalize interests with an Apache Corporation subsidiary, resulting in Chevron Canada Limited and Apache each holding a 50% interest in both the Kitimat LNG Project and PTP. Operatorship of both facilities will transfer to Chevron Canada Limited. The proposed two-train Kitimat LNG Project, currently progressing through the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase, has a Canadian National Energy Board license to export 10 million tons per annum of LNG. Additionally, Chevron Canada Limited will acquire approximately 110,000 net acres in the established Horn River Basin from Encana, EOG and Apache, and approximately 212,000 net acres in the Liard Basin from Apache. Chevron Canada Limited and Apache will each hold a 50% interest and Apache will operate these two natural gas resource developments.Â
