Friday, 24 Feb 2012 01:08pm EST
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that the city will buy 500 Ford Motor Company's Police Interceptor sedans and utility vehicles, the commitment to date for the all-new vehicles. The Police Interceptor sedan and utility vehicles started production at the Company's Chicago Assembly Plant last month, adding 230 jobs at the Torrence Avenue plant with additional manufacturing and support jobs expected in the future. Ford specially designed and engineered an all-new Police Interceptor sedan and utility to handle the rigors of police work, working hand-in-hand with its Police Advisory Board of law enforcement professionals.Â
