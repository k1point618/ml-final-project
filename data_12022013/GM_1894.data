Spyker NV's Sues General Motors Co For Over $3 Billion On Saab Bankruptcy-Reuters
Tuesday, 7 Aug 2012 01:54am EDT
Reuters reported that Spyker NV is suing General Motors Co (GM) for more than $3 billion on behalf of its subsidiary Saab, accusing the U.S. automaker of deliberately bankrupting the Swedish group by blocking a deal with a Chinese investor. Saab Automobile stopped production in May 2011 when it could no longer pay suppliers and employees. It went bust in December, less than two years after GM sold it to Spyker. GM's efforts to kill any sale were made to eliminate a potential rival in China, Spyker said. 'GM never intended to allow Saab to compete with it in China,' Spyker said in its complaint, filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan. 'When Saab found a way to secure liquidity and continue as a going concern with the help of Chinese investors, GM was determined to scuttle the deal by any means necessary, including the publication of false information about its rights under the parties’ contracts,' Spyker added. GM spokesman Dave Roman called the lawsuit without merit. He told reporters the $3 billion claim was based on what Saab would have been worth if a deal with Chinese firm Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co, or Youngman, had gone ahead.
