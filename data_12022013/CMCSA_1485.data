Reuters reported that Sprint Nextel Corp's $2.2 billion offer for Clearwire Corp is likely to face resistance from Clearwire's minority shareholders, but accepting the offer may prove to be their best option. The Company could face a restructuring if shareholders fail to approve the acquisition, which calls for majority shareholder Sprint to pay $2.97 per share for the roughly outstanding 50% of Clearwire it doesn't already own. Sprint has already has support for the deal from owners of 13% of Clearwire shares, Comcast Corp, Intel Corp and Bright House Networks LLC.Â
