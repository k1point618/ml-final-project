Eastman Kodak Company Sues Apple Inc., Claiming Interference In Patent Sales-Reuters
Tuesday, 19 Jun 2012 09:48pm EDT
Reuters reported that Eastman Kodak Company sued Apple Inc. to stop it from interfering with plans to sell a large patent portfolio, a significant part of its bankruptcy restructuring. In a lawsuit filed on Monday in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Kodak said Apple wrongly claims to own 10 patents arising from work that the companies did together in the early 1990s. Privately held FlashPoint Technology Inc also claims ownership through an assignment from Apple, which spun it off in 1996, and is also a defendant, Kodak said. The patents include technology that helps camera owners preview photographs on LCD screens. They are part of Kodak's digital-capture portfolio, which the company said includes more than 700 patents for devices such as digital cameras, smartphones and tablets, and has generated more than $3 billion in revenues since 2001.Â
