Consumer Class Action Brought Against Ford Motor Co, Alleging Defects in its Dashboard Infotainment System, MyFord Touch
Tuesday, 16 Jul 2013 07:47pm EDT
A federal class action has been filed this week against Ford Motor Co. in connection with alleged defects in the MyFord Touch dashboard infotainment systems that are found in Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. The action was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by leading consumer class action law firm of Grant & Eisenhofer P.A., and other firms. The suit, brought by the Center for Defensive Driving, a nonprofit educator based in Torrance, Calif., seeks compensatory relief on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers and lessees of Ford vehicles equipped with MyFord Touch systems, excluding those who have personal injury claims resulting from the defect in the systems. Introduced to Ford vehicles in 2010, the MyFord Touch (called "MyLincoln Touch," or "MyMercury Touch" in Lincoln and Mercury cars) is Ford's LCD dashboard interface which allows the vehicle owner to operate the vehicle's audio systems, GPS navigation, climate systems, as well as a Bluetooth enabled mobile device. The MyFord Touch also allows operation of certain safety systems in the vehicle, such as collision detection that subsequently dials 9-1-1 to connect the vehicle to an emergency services provider.Â
