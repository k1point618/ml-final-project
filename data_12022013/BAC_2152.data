Thursday, 24 Oct 2013 11:42am EDT
Reuters reported that according to the Wall Street Journal, Bank of America Corp is looking to cut 3,000 mortgage jobs before the end of the year to cope with declines in refinancing and in its portfolio of delinquent home loans. About 1,200 mortgage employees received notice that their position would be eliminated on Thursday, the newspaper said. A majority of the 3,000 cuts will come from temporary contractors, though full-time employees will also be laid off. A Bank of America spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Â
