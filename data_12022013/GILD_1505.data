Gilead Sciences Inc's Ranexa Reduces Angina Frequency in Study of Chronic Angina Patients With Type 2 Diabetes
Sunday, 10 Mar 2013 02:57pm EDT
Gilead Sciences Inc announced data from the Phase 4 TERISA (Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine In Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina) study, which demonstrated that the addition of ranolazine to background antianginal therapy in chronic angina patients with type 2 diabetes significantly reduced the frequency of weekly angina episodes compared to placebo and background antianginal therapy. Ranexa (ranolazine) is indicated for the treatment of chronic angina. Ranexa is not indicated for the treatment of diabetes and should not be considered a treatment for diabetes. Chronic angina, the most common symptom of coronary artery disease, can be a debilitating heart condition. Angina typically manifests as recurrent pain or tightness in the chest upon exertion or emotional stress. Patients with diabetes have more extensive coronary artery disease and a propensity for greater angina burden compared to patients without diabetes. Following a single-blind, four-week placebo run-in phase, 927 randomized patients received ranolazine (twice-daily 500 mg up-titrated to twice-daily 1,000 mg on Day 8) (n=462) or matching placebo (n=465) in addition to background antianginal therapy for eight weeks. Patients were asked to document the number of angina episodes and sublingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin doses taken on a daily basis using an electronic diary.Â
