Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co's fund unit is expecting to raise up to $150 million in Taiwan to invest in A shares in mainland China, marking the first such fund as cross-strait ties accelerate. The move comes as China said this week that it will allot investment quotas of up to 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) for Taiwanese seeking to put money into its financial markets under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) programme.Â
