Nine Oil Companies Including Exxon Mobil Corporation Bid For Uruguay Offshore Blocks-Reuters
Thursday, 29 Mar 2012 07:00pm EDT
Reuters reported that nine energy companies have submitted 19 bids to explore for oil off the coast of energy-poor Uruguay. The discovery of massive deep-water reserves off Brazil's Atlantic coast has encouraged neighboring Uruguay to look for energy resources along its own coastline in hopes of reducing its dependence on imports. The foreign energy companies submitted a total of 19 bids for eight of the 15 blocks offered for exploration. The bids were made by Britain's BP Plc and BG Group plc, France's TOTAL S.A., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Tullow Oil plc and Exxon Mobil Corporation. Consortiums made up of Spain's Cepsa, Murphy and Argentina's YPF SA also made offers.Â
