US Court Revives Apple Inc's Claim On Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Tablets-Reuters
Monday, 14 May 2012 06:51pm EDT
Reuters reported that A US appeals court ruled on Monday that Apple Inc could press its bid for an immediate injunction to block the sale of some tablet computers made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd based on allegations of infringement of one patent. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the judge in a district court in California had erred in deciding that Apple failed to show that it was likely to succeed on the merits and sent the case back to the district count for further review. Appeals court also ruled that the lower court was right to deny Apple requested preliminary injunctions which would have stopped sale of Samsung smartphones and tablets based on three other patents. The three patents include two that have to do with smartphone design and a third related to scrolling. The patent ruling in Washington is part of a larger legal proceeding in California. Apple sued Samsung in US last year, saying Samsung's Galaxy line of mobile phones and tablets "slavishly" copies the iPhone and iPad. Samsung then countersued Apple. In mid-April, Both agreed that their chief executives would participate in settlement talks to try to resolve the dispute, according to an order by US District Judge Lucy Koh. One of three judges hearing the case dissented from part of majority decision, saying that the finding for Apple in the tablet design patent should not result in ruling returning the issue to the lower court but that Apple should have been granted its injunction.Â
