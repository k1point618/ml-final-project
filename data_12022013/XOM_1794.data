BP Plc Lost Again In Arctic Deal To Exxon Mobil Corporation-Reuters
Tuesday, 5 Mar 2013 04:55am EST
Reuters reported that BP Plc, which lost its first deal to drill for oil in Russia's Arctic to Exxon Mobil Corporation, tried to negotiate a new deal with Russian state oil company Rosneft and was again beaten to the punch by its U.S. rival. ExxonMobil won access to the Arctic Laptev Sea fields, where Rosneft's prospective reserves amount to 36 billion barrels of oil equivalent, under a deal last month, but three industry sources said BP had also been in talks with Rosneft to explore several blocks there.Â
