Reuters reported that Siena prosecutors requested that JPMorgan Chase & Co stand trial for obstructing regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's purchase of Banca Antonveneta, said a judicial source. Prosecutors allege JPMorgan withheld information from Italian regulators about a EUR1 billion ($1.36 billion) financing the New York-based bank arranged for Italian bank Monte Paschi's takeover of domestic rival Antonveneta in 2008.Â
