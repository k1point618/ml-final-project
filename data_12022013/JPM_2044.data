JPMorgan Chase & Co's Private Equity Unit To Become Independent-Reuters
Saturday, 15 Jun 2013 12:38pm EDT
Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co said its private equity unit, One Equity Partners, will become independent, as the bank increases its focus on client businesses. One Equity Partners, which manages $4.5 billion of investments, will raise its next investment fund externally rather than from JPMorgan, becoming similar to stand-alone private equity firms that pool funds from a variety of investors.Â
