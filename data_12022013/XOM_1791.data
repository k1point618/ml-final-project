Anadarko Petroleum Corp Has Talked With Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell PLC About Mozambique Gas Stake-DJ
Thursday, 14 Mar 2013 12:19pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Anadarko Petroleum Corp has held early-stage talks with energy companies Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC about selling a share of the U.S. oil firm's massive natural gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique. The discovery of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas offshore Mozambique by Anadarko and Italy's Eni SpA has piqued the interest of some of energy companies, which are keen to get a foothold in an area well placed to serve energy-hungry Asian export markets. Anadarko, an oil and gas exploration company based outside Houston, has said it wants to sell up to 10% of its share of the energy trove.Â
