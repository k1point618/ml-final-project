Chevron Corp, Repsol YPF SA and Statoil ASA Sign Partnership Agreement For Well Drilling Off Newfoundland-Reuters
Thursday, 12 Jan 2012 02:37pm EST
Reuters reported that Chevron Corp, Repsol YPF SA and Statoil ASA have agreed to fund part of the cost of drilling a third well at Chevron's property in the Orphan Basin off Newfoundland after its partners in two prior efforts pulled out. Following the agreement, Chevron will keep a 65% stake in the exploration block located in Atlantic waters about 350 kilometers (220 miles) northeast of St John's, Newfoundland, off Canada's East Coast. Repsol will hold a 20% stake in the exploration block while Statoil will have the remainder in return for paying part of the costs for the new well to be drilled later this year.Â
