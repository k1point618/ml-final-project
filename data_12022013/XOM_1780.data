Exxon Mobil Corp To Sell Over Half Of Iraq Oilfield Stake To PetroChina Co Ltd, Pertamina-Reuters
Friday, 23 Aug 2013 06:12am EDT
Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil Corp is selling over half of 60% holding in Iraq's West Qurna-1 oilfield project to China's energy firm PetroChina and Indonesia's Pertamina. Exxon Mobil is the operator of the giant oilfield and last year had offered to sell entire stake after a dispute with Baghdad over contracts it signed with autonomous Kurdistan, deals which the central government rejects as illegal.Â
