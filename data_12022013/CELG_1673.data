Celgene Corporation's Celgene International Sàrl Announces Results From Comparative Analysis Of REVLIMID
Sunday, 11 Dec 2011 09:27pm EST
Celgene International Sàrl, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation announced results from a retrospective analysis to assess the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression and death in REVLIMID (lenalidomide)-treated versus untreated patients with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with IPSS Low or Int-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with deletion 5q chromosome (with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities). In this retrospective analysis, 295 lenalidomide-treated patients from two Celgene-sponsored multicenter trials, MDS-003 and MDS-004, were compared with 125 untreated patients from an international multi-center MDS Registry with similar baseline characteristics who had received best supportive care only, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in some patients. Baseline characteristics of lenalidomide-treated patients were similar to registry patients, except for a higher RBC transfusion burden among lenalidomide-treated patients (median [range] units/8 weeks: 6 [1-25] vs. 2 [1-10]). The lenalidomide-treated patients benefited from a reduction in risk of death, while no risk of progression to AML was observed, despite a higher transfusion burden at baseline compared with patients from MDS registry who had not received lenalidomide. The two- and five-year cumulative overall survival (OS) probabilities were 90% and 54% for patients treated with lenalidomide compared with 74% and 41% for patients not treated with lenalidomide.
