China Approves Ford Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Chongqing Changan Automotive Co Ltd To Split JV In Two-The Economic Times
Monday, 27 Aug 2012 01:02am EDT
The Economic Times reported that Ford Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp and their local Chinese partner Chongqing Changan Automotive Co have received approval from China's central government to split their three-way, manufacturing and sales joint venture into two, Ford's Chief Executive said on Monday. With approval, Ford Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp- which share two major manufacturing bases in Chongqing and the eastern city of Nanjing - are likely to establish a new structure for cooperating with their common Chinese partner. It will likely split those China operations into two separate entities, with the Chongqing operations owned and operated by Ford and Changan, and the Nanjing base by Mazda and Changan, executives close to the three-way joint venture said.Â
