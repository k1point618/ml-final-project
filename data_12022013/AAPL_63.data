Apple Inc Seeks Quick Bans On Eight Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Phones-Reuters
Monday, 27 Aug 2012 11:55pm EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc is seeking speedy bans on the sale of eight Samsung Electronics Co Ltd phones, moving swiftly to translate its resounding court victory over its rival into a tangible business benefit. The company wasted no time in identifying its targets on Monday: eight older-model smartphones, including the Galaxy S2 and Droid Charge. While Apple's lawsuit encompassed 28 devices, many of those accused products are no longer widely available in the mobile market. Although Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S III phone was not included in the trial, the jury validated Apple’s patents on features and design elements that the U.S. company could then try to wield against that device.
