Germany Probes General Motors Co, PSA Peugeot Tie-up-DJ
Wednesday, 4 Jul 2012 05:06am EDT
Dow Jones reported that German competition authorities is examining the global alliance between General Motors Co, which owns the German Opel brand, and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen. Germany's federal cartel office was particularly interested in what repercussions the tie-up would have for car parts suppliers. The probe is expected to last three months. In an alliance unveiled in February, the two auto giants said they would develop joint platforms and technologies and pool their purchasing activities to cut costs. As part of the tie-up, GM said earlier this month it would transfer most of its logistics activities in Europe to Gefco, a wholly owned subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen. The agreement, which comes into effect in 2013, will cover most of the logistics activities in Europe, including Russia, of Opel/Vauxhall, Chevrolet and Cadillac. It includes services such as material and component deliveries to manufacturing plants, delivery of finished vehicles to dealerships and the transport of after-sales spare parts to distribution centers.Â
