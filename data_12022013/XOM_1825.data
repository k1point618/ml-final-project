Canacol Energy Ltd. And ExxonMobil Sign Agreement For Shale Oil Exploration Project In Colombia
Wednesday, 4 Apr 2012 05:15pm EDT
Canacol Energy Ltd. announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Carrao Energy Sucursal Colombia, has entered into a farm-out agreement with ExxonMobil Exploration Colombia Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation for the exploration of the Corporation's non-operated VMM 2 exploration and production contract located in the Middle Magdalena basin of Colombia. The VMM 2 E&P contract is one of three adjacent contracts that Canacol has interests in, representing 126,000 net acres that expose Canacol to a potentially large, unconventional shale oil play. With $ 91 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on hand as of December 31, 2011, and cash flow from its operated oil producing assets in Colombia, the Corporation remains fully funded to execute its exploration and development programs for 2012.Â
