JPMorgan Chase & Co Wins Dismissal Of Silver Price-Fixing Lawsuit-Reuters
Monday, 18 Mar 2013 04:54pm EDT
Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co has won the dismissal of a nationwide investors' lawsuit accusing the U.S. bank of conspiring to drive down silver prices. U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in Manhattan said the investors, who bought and sold COMEX silver futures and options contracts, failed to show that JPMorgan manipulated prices at their expense, including by amassing huge short positions that were not justified by market events at the time. In a decision made public on Monday, Patterson said that while the investors showed that JPMorgan had the ability to influence prices, a fact the bank did not dispute, they failed to show that the bank "intended to cause artificial prices to exist" and acted accordingly. The complaint had sought triple damages for what it called JPMorgan's antitrust violations in distorting silver prices between 2007 and 2010, including through alleged "fake" trades late in the day when market volume was thin.Â
