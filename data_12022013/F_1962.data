Ford Motor Co Recalls More Than 154,000 Fiesta Subcompact For Air Bag Problem-The Economic Times
Tuesday, 16 Oct 2012 07:53am EDT
The Economic Times reported that Ford Motor Co is recalling more than 154,000 Fiesta subcompacts to fix a problem with the side air bags. The Company says that if the front passenger seat is empty, the side air bag won't inflate to protect rear-seat passengers in some crashes. Ford says it doesn't know of any crashes or injuries linked to the problem. The recall affects Fiestas from the 2011 through 2013 model years. They were built in Mexico from November 3, 2009 to September 21, 2012. Dealers will reprogram the computer that controls the side air bag so it inflates even if no one is in the front passenger seat. The repair will be done for free.Â
