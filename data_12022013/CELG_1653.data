Bionor Pharma ASA's Study of Vacc-4x Combined with Celgene Corp's Revlimid in HIV Patients with Impaired Immune System Approved to Begin
Monday, 13 Aug 2012 02:30am EDT
Bionor Pharma ASA announced that the clinical trial application for the placebo-controlled study with Vacc-4x in combination with Celgene Corp's Revlimid has been approved by the German health regulatory authorities. The study will be conducted at four different clinics in Germany, and will include HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) patients who do not recover a normal CD4 T-cell count (measurement of the immune system) despite receiving conventional HIV medicine (antiretroviral therapy, ART). The two main objectives of the study are to investigate the ability of Vacc-4x to improve the CD4 T-cell count in patients who have failed to regain these T helper cell counts to nearly normal levels despite well controlled viral load on ART, and to investigate whether Revlimid can further enhance the immune stimulating effect of Vacc-4x. The study will be conducted in Germany and coordinated by the principal investigator Prof. Jan van Lunzen, MD. The first phase of the study will determine the optimal dose of Revlimid in combination with Vacc-4x. The second phase is placebo-controlled, double-blind and includes 24 patients, where half of them will receive Vacc-4x in combination with the selected Revlimid dose, while the other half will receive Vacc-4x alone. The study period of the second phase is 26 weeks. Bionor Pharma is the study sponsor and the costs will be shared evenly between Bionor Pharma and Celgene Corp.Â
