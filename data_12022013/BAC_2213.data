Bank of America Corp Settles U.S. Probe Related To Disabled Borrowers-Reuters
Thursday, 13 Sep 2012 06:52pm EDT
Reuters reported that Bank of America Corp has agreed to settle U.S. Department of Justice civil accusations that it violated federal laws by discriminating against mortgage applicants on the basis of disability. The accord resolves allegations Bank of America Corp, which made about $152 billion of first mortgages in 2011, imposed extra burdens on borrowers who relied on Social Security disability insurance income to qualify on home loans, including that they provide letters from doctors to document that income. Bank of America's activity violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Justice Department said. While the cost of the settlement is unclear, Bank of America agreed to pay $1,000, $2,500 or $5,000 to eligible mortgage loan applicants who were asked to provide doctors' letters. It also agreed to hire an outsider to review 25,000 loan applications to identify other possible victims and to improve the training of underwriters and loan officers. Bank of America denied the allegations in agreeing to the settlement, which requires approval by the federal court in its hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. The bank had been charged with discrimination in February by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which referred the matter to the Justice Department. Bank of America changed its documentation policies during the HUD probe.Â
