Big Fire Hits Chevron Corp's California Refinery-Reuters
Tuesday, 7 Aug 2012 12:01am EDT
Reuters reported that a fire struck the core of Chevron Corp's large Richmond, California, refinery on Monday evening, sending flames and a column of smoke into the air and prompting authorities to order nearby residents indoors. The fire, which authorities said was still blazing more than two and a half hours after it erupted, hit the sole crude unit at the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant, which accounts for one-eighth of the state's refining capacity. A lasting outage at the refinery could cause a swift rise in gasoline prices across the West Coast, a region that is isolated from other markets. Nearby residents were advised to shelter in place, an order often given during significant refinery accidents to shield against possible exposure to dangerous chemicals or smoke. Chevron said in a statement that there had been only one minor injury at the refinery. Online photos showed the blaze sending a plume of black smoke into the air over the plant, which is located in a densely populated, industrial East Bay suburb of San Francisco. Four Bay Area Rapid Transit stations were shut. Chevron said the fire had started in the No. 4 crude unit at 6:15 p.m. local time, and it was not known when it might be extinguished. Sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide were released during the incident, according to a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency.Â
