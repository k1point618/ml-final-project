JPMorgan Chase & Co. Stops Stock Buybacks; Maintains Dividend-Reuters
Monday, 21 May 2012 02:57pm EDT
Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s CEO Jamie Dimon took another step in the wake of $2 billion loss, or more, on derivatives by announcing on Monday that the Company will quit spending capital on stock buybacks. The Company will suspend for now a $15 billion share repurchase plan that Federal Reserve regulators had just approved in March after running stress tests on the bank's capital. The move will give JPMorgan added protection against having to reduce its quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share, which the bank will maintain.Â
