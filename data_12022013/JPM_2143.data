JPMorgan Chase & Co Settles Overdraft Fee Case For $110 Million-Reuters
Monday, 6 Feb 2012 11:50am EST
Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $110 million to settle consumer litigation accusing it of charging excessive overdraft fees. The settlement was disclosed in a filing on Friday with the U.S. district court in Miami. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King, who oversees litigation from across the country against more than two dozen lenders over the fees. In the litigation, consumers accused lenders of routinely processing transactions from largest to smallest rather than in chronological order. This can cause overdraft fees, typically $25 or $35, to pile up because account balances will fall faster. Critics say this disproportionately burdens customers with lower incomes or balances. In 2010, the Federal Reserve barred banks from charging the fees on electronic and debit card transactions without advance customer approval.Â
