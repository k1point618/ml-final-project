Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against General Motors Co
Wednesday, 11 Jul 2012 09:50pm EDT
Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP announced that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of General Motors Co pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's November 18, 2010 initial public offering (the IPO), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Act of 1933. The Complaint alleges that the Company’s Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO were materially false and misleading. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) GM was predicting revenue based on production rather than actual sales; (2) the Company falsely assured investors that it was actively managing its production by monitoring its dealer inventory levels; and (3) the Company assured investors that its inventory management would improve in 2011, which would improve average transaction price.
