Reuters reported that Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp is suing more than a dozen banks for losses from the alleged manipulation of the benchmark interest rate known as Libor. Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG are among the banks named as defendants in the lawsuit. Freddie Mac, which invested in mortgage bonds and swaps tied to U.S. dollar Libor, claims the banks colluded to rig the benchmark from 2007 to 2010, according to the complaint, which was filed March 14, 2013 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Credit Suisse and other banks did not immediately respond to calls for comment or declined to comment.Â
