Bank of America Corp Sues MBIA Inc-Reuters
Saturday, 15 Dec 2012 06:03pm EST
Reuters reported that Bank of America Corp has sued bond insurer MBIA Inc in a New York state court for allegedly interfering with the bank's offer to buy MBIA's bonds. Bank of America said it had purchased $136 million of senior notes in that tender and issued a default notice over the attempt to change terms. The bank claims in the lawsuit that the consent solicitation was the latest of MBIA’s premeditated and subversive actions since 2008 to benefit executives and stockholders to the detriment of Bank of America and other policyholders. In the lawsuit filed Bank of America alleged that MBIA illegally interfered with its tender offer and asked for the consent solicitation and amendment to be declared invalid. The bank also is seeking punitive and other damages.
