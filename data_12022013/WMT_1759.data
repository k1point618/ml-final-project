University of California Sues Facebook Inc, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Over Patents-Reuters
Thursday, 13 Sep 2012 01:00pm EDT
Reuters reported that a University of California patent licensee which has sued some of the U.S. companies is taking on three more, Facebook Inc, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Walt Disney Company. Eolas Technologies Inc and the Regents of the University of California filed lawsuits on Wednesday over four patents they believe the companies are infringing. The patents for interactive technology, including hypermedia display and interaction, were issued to the university and licensed to Eolas, a Texas company chaired by Michael Doyle. The company was founded to help the University of California commercialize patent technology, its website says, including patents Doyle and his team helped develop while he worked at the University of California, San Francisco.Â
