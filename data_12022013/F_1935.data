Ford Motor Co's Ford Romania to Stop Production for One Week in September 2013-Reuters News
Friday, 30 Aug 2013 03:34am EDT
Reuters News reported that the Romanian unit of Ford Motor Co will stop production for one week in September 2013 to adjust to weak European market demand. Ford Motor Co, which took over Romanian carmaker Automobile Craiova in 2008, started production of its B-Max model at the Craiova plant in 2012. It now makes 370 cars per day and roughly 1,000 engines. Ford Romania Spokeswoman Ana Maria Timis said that in September 2013 there will be seven days during which the B-Max will not be produced. Ms. Timis added 2,500 employees, or about half of Ford Romania's workforce, will be affected by the production halt. They will receive 80% of their wages for the week.Â
