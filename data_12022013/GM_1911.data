General Motors Co Proposed Taking Over One-Third Of Isuzu Motors Limited-Reuters
Wednesday, 2 May 2012 01:53am EDT
Reuters reported that General Motors Co first proposed taking a controlling stake of more than one-third in Isuzu Motors Limited - an investment worth some $3 billion - but is now seeking a smaller holding after the Japanese truck maker said it wanted to remain independent, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said. General Motors Co at one point owned as much as 49% in Isuzu before selling the holding down, disappointed with red ink spilled by Isuzu at the time and later strapped for cash of its own. Its last remaining 7.9% stake was sold in 2006 for $300 million.Â
