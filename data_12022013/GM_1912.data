General Motors Co In Deal To Buy Stake From Chinese Partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd-Reuters
Wednesday, 18 Apr 2012 05:33pm EDT
Reuters reported that General Motors Co and Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd have agreed to allow GM to buy back the 1% share of the joint venture (JV) the Detroit automaker sold during its financial crisis several years ago. This would bring the venture back to a 50-50 split for operations in China including setting the budget and picking company leaders, and would allow SAIC to retain a 51% share on the sales side of the business. This 51%-share of the sales operations would allow SAIC to keep control of booking revenue for the joint venture, called Shanghai GM. The agreement between GM and SAIC must attain regulatory approval from Chinese government officials.Â
