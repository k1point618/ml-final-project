Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Tuesday, 15 May 2012 05:15pm EDT
Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP announced that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan or the Company) between April 13, 2012 and May 11, 2012, inclusive (the Class Period), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. JPMorgan is a financial holding company that provides various financial services worldwide. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements concerning the Company’s operations and financial prospects. Specifically, defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that the Company’s Chief Investment Office had engaged in extremely risky and speculative trades that exposed JPMorgan to significant losses. On May 10, 2012 the Company revealed that JPMorgan had sustained a multibillion dollar trading loss as a result of a risky strategy to hedge the Company’s credit exposure. In response to this disclosure, JPMorgan’s stock price declined from $40.74 per share to a closing price of $36.96 per share on extremely heavy trading volume
