Zamansky & Associates Announces Investigation Of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Over Sales Of Mutual Funds And Chase Strategic Portfolios

Zamansky & Associates LLC announced that it is investigating JPMorgan Chase & Co. over sales of mutual funds and Chase Strategic Portfolios for possible securities fraud and/or breaches of duties owed to bank and brokerage firm customers. On July 3, 2012, The New York Times published an article entitled Former Brokers Say JP Morgan Favored Selling Bank`s Own Fund Over Others. This article reported that JP Morgan encouraged its financial advisers to favor JP Morgan's own products even when competitors had better-performing or cheaper options. With one crucial offering, JP Morgan exaggerated the returns of what it was selling in marketing materials, according to documents reviewed by The Times. Additionally, JP Morgan was ordered by arbitrators to pay $373 million to a competitor for favoring its products, despite an agreement it had to sell alternatives. While investors have pulled money from stock funds, JP Morgan has gathered assets in its stock funds at a rapid rate, despite having only a small group of top-performing mutual funds. Over the last three years, roughly 42 percent of its funds failed to beat the average performance of funds that make similar investments, according to Morningstar, a fund researcher. I was selling JP Morgan funds that often had weak performance records, and I was doing it for no other reason than to enrich the firm, said Geoffrey Tomes, who left JP Morgan last year. I couldn't call myself objective.Â
