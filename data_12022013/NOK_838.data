Standard & Poor's Rating Services Lowers Long-Term Corporate Credit Rating and Affirms Short-Term Corporate Credit Rating for Nokia Oyj
Wednesday, 15 Aug 2012 07:45am EDT
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) announced that it has lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Nokia Oyj to 'BB-' from 'BB+' and affirmed its 'B' short-term corporate credit rating. The outlook is negative. The rating actions reflect a downward revision of S&P's estimates of revenues and profitability for Nokia's smartphone operations in 2012 and 2013. S&P has subsequently revised cash flow assumptions, including impact from Nokia's restructuring of Devices and Services division. In line with its criteria, S&P has therefore revised assessment of Nokia's business risk profile to "weak" from "fair" and that of the financial risk profile to "significant" from "intermediate". The short-term rating is 'B'. S&P assesses the Group's liquidity as "strong," as defined in S&P's criteria. The group's liquidity can more than cover its needs over the near term, even if EBITDA were to decline sharply for a limited period or if NSN were unable to draw on a EUR 750 million multicurrency revolving credit facility. The group has good relationships with its banks. The negative outlook reflects the possibility of a downgrade over the next 12 months if the non-IFRS operating margin of Nokia's Devices and Services division or consolidated FOCF remains significantly negative, since this would reduce Nokia's net cash position further. This could be the case for instance if revenues from Lumia smartphones did not increase significantly during 2013 or if margins deteriorated further.Â
