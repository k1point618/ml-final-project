Ford Motor Co Agrees To Pay Federal Government $17.35 Million In Settlement-DJ

Dow Jones reported that Ford Motor Co agreed to pay the federal government $17.35 million in a settlement over whether it took too long to recall vehicles that could have defect causing unintended acceleration. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Ford last July to recall 423,000 Ford Escape SUVs because they could have a flaw that caused the accelerator pedal to stay depressed after drivers took their foot off of them. During the investigation process, the safety agency also found evidence that Ford may have known about the safety problem and didn't tell customers or the government, a violation of federal law, the regulator said in the settlement document dated June 28, 2013. Ford agreed to pay NHTSA, but denies that it broke any laws. The agreement doesn't release Ford from civil or criminal liability, the document says.Â
