Wednesday, 15 Aug 2012 07:19am EDT
Reuters reported that Ukraine has selected a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to develop its Skifska gas and oil field in the Black Sea. The project, whose total costs have been estimated by the government at $10-$12 billion, is part of the former Soviet republic's plan to ease its dependence on gas imported from Russia. Skifska, predominantly a gas field, is estimated to hold reserves of 200 to 250 bcm of gas, he said, and is expected to eventually produce 5 bcm a year.Â
