Ford Motor Company Sued, Said To Hide Truck Fuel Tank Defect-Reuters
Thursday, 15 Mar 2012 01:49pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Company has been sued for allegedly selling trucks with defective fuel tank linings over a 10-year period, and hiding the problem from consumers even as it warned dealers. The lawsuit filed on Wednesday in a New Jersey federal court said fuel tank linings on 10 E- and F-series truck models made between 1999 and 2008 would 'separate and flake off'. It said this would clog fuel systems with debris and rust, causing a sudden loss of engine power, and potentially causing vehicles to buck or kick or suddenly stall.Â
