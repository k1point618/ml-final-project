EMC Corporation Enables State of Michigan's Transformation To IT-As-a-Service
Tuesday, 10 Jul 2012 09:00am EDT
Emc Corp announced that the State of Michigan's IT organization is using EMC storage, software and professional services to further transform how IT services are delivered to agencies and residents. The State of Michigan has always been responsive to individual agency requests - but a new IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) model will enable even better partnership with agencies to identify their needs and provide service catalogs with defined rate structures that make it easier for agencies to "shop" for services. As a result, EMC is helping the State of Michigan provide even greater responsiveness to the fast-changing needs of its agencies and citizens, improving the quality of online services for Michigan residents and dramatically reducing IT capital and operational expenditures. The State standardized on EMC technologies including EMC VMAX storage that is configured with Fully Automated Storage Tiering for Virtual Pools (FAST VP) and data-at-rest encryption (DARE). The State uses EMC RecoverPoint™ remote data protection solution for disaster recovery, as well as EMC Data Domain for backup and recovery. The virtualization environment includes VMware virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions including vSphere server virtualization with vCenter Site Recovery Manager and vCloud Director, as well as Citrix XenApp. EMC Global Services was engaged to help implement the virtualized infrastructure and educate internal customers on the value of VCOE services.
