International Business Machines Corp Announces Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital To Improve Healthcare With IBM Smarter Computing
Thursday, 29 Mar 2012 08:00am EDT
International Business Machines Corp announced that the Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital has embraced the Company's smarter computing approach to IT to build the country's first integrated hospital infrastructure. IBM Korea was chosen for this project to create a workload optimized system that was able to support doctors and other health providers in all four locations, and enable them all to work together to improve patient care and accountability. Under the agreement signed in December 2011, IBM is delivering a full range of technologies from processing and storage to virtualization. Among the many systems to be implemented will be IBM Power 780 and 740 systems equipped with PowerVM virtualization; IBM System x3650 M3 systems; IBM System Storage DS8000 high capacity storage, IBM Storwize V7000 Unified Storage Systems, and much more. All told, the new infrastructure will be capable of handling more than 100 TB of data (the approximate equivalent of more than 650 billion photos on Facebook). The hospital will leverage the new infrastructure to host a next-generation integrated medical information system called "SU-III Project" which establishes a single electronic medical records system with a single database.Â
