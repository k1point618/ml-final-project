No Jury For Ecuadoreans, Lawyer In Chevron Corp's Fraud Trial-Reuters
Monday, 7 Oct 2013 01:32pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ecuadorean villagers and a U.S. lawyer who represents them are not entitled to a jury in an upcoming trial over whether they used fraud to win an $18 billion pollution award against Chevron Corp, a U.S. judge ruled on October 07, 2013. Chevron alleges that the villagers and their lawyer, Steven Donziger, used fraud and bribery to obtain the award in an Ecuadorean court in 2011. At the trial in federal court in New York that begins on October 15, the oil company is seeking to prevent them from profiting from the award. In a written opinion on October 07, 2013, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said the villagers and Donziger are not entitled to a jury because Chevron is not seeking damages claims against them.Â
