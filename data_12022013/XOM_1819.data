Exxon Mobil Corp To Reconfigure UK Plant, Close Crude Unit-Reuters
Thursday, 21 Jun 2012 01:26pm EDT
Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil Corp will reconfigure its Fawley refinery, permanently decommissioning one crude distillation unit. The reconfiguration includes the decommissioning of one of Fawley’s three 'pipestills' -installations more commonly known as distillation towers, in which crude oil is boiled to separate it into its component parts. This is scheduled to take place in September 2012. The pipestill that is being decommissioned produces fuel oil, of which there is excess supply in the UK, and gas oil, which is currently being exported to a declining West African market. The company said there would not be any job losses after the decommissioning. The company did not specify the capacity of the crude distillation unit to be decommissioned.
