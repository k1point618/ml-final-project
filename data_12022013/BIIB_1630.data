FDA Updates On Biogen Idec Inc and Elan Corporation, plc's TYSABRI (natalizumab) Label To Include Anti-JC Virus Antibody Status As PML Risk Factor
Monday, 23 Jan 2012 02:00am EST
Biogen Idec Inc and Elan Corporation, plc announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a product label change for TYSABRI that will help enable individual benefit risk assessment for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The new label identifies anti-JCV antibody status as a risk factor for developing an infrequent but serious brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This marks the third risk factor identified to help physicians and people with MS have more confidence in their treatment decisions when considering TYSABRI, effective treatment for relapsing forms of MS. The label update was based on analysis of data from Biogen Idec’s and Elan's quantitative risk stratification algorithm, which was presented at a number of international medical meetings, including the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in April, 2011. In the analysis, patients who were anti-JCV antibody positive were at an increased risk for developing PML with varying degrees of risk depending on prior IS use and TYSABRI treatment duration. Irrespective of MS treatment, approximately 55% of MS patients are anti-JCV positive.
