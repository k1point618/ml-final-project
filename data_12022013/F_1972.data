Ford Motor Co Recalls 1.6-Liter Ford Escape-Reuters
Thursday, 19 Jul 2012 02:58pm EDT
Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co told owners to stop driving 2013 model Ford Escape with 1.6-liter engines immediately due to the risk of an engine fire. Ford recalled about 11,500 new 2013 model Ford Escape SUVs with 1.6-liter engines, of which about 4,800 were sold to customers in the U.S. and Canadian markets, the Company said. Most of the rest are on dealer lots. Only Ford Escape with 1.6-liter engines sold in the U.S. and Canadian markets are affected by the recall and fire risk, Ford said. Ford said an under-the-hood fire could happen due to an engine compartment fuel line that could split and leak fuel. Bragman referred to the fact that of the three incidents of under-the-hood fires reported by Ford, two occurred at the production plant as they were being shuttled from assembly line to a parking lot to await shipment. Of the 11,500 recalled Escapes, 9,300 are in the United States and the remainder in Canada, Zwiebel said. The Escape with the 1.6-liter engine involved in the recall and with the problem were made through July 11, 2012 Ford said.Â
