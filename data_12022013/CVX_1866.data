Chevron Corp To Sell Wheatstone Equity, More LNG To Tokyo Electric Power Co-Reuters
Monday, 18 Jun 2012 04:05am EDT
Reuters reported that Chevron Corp has signed a deal to supply additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Tokyo Electric Power Co.(TEPCO), as well as an equity stake in the Wheatstone project in Australia. TEPCO will purchase an additional 0.4 million metric tons (0.44 million tons) per year (mtpa) of LNG from the Chevron-operated Wheatstone project for up to 20 years, adding to the 3.1 mtpa it had agreed to buy last year. Chevron will also sell an 8% stake in the Wheatstone natural gas processing plant and a 10% interest in the Wheatstone gas field licenses, which will bump TEPCO's total offtake of LNG from Wheatstone up to a total of 4.2 mtpa. The Company did not give financial value for the agreement.Â
