The Briscoe Law Firm and Powers Taylor, LLP Announce Investigation Of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. For Possible Violations Of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Monday, 23 Apr 2012 11:42am EDT
Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe, founder of The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC, and the securities litigation firm of Powers Taylor, LLP announced that the firms are investigating legal claims against the officers and Board of Directors of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for potential breaches of fiduciary duties and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Specifically, the New York Times recently published an article alleging that Walmart was involved in a massive bribery scandal in Mexico. In response to the New York Times investigation, Walmart informed the United States Justice Department that it has initiated an internal investigation into potential violations of the FCPA and other local laws. On April 21, 2012, the New York Times published an article about its investigation into an alleged bribery scheme by Walmart’s largest foreign subsidiary, Walmart de Mexico. Notably, the report claims that Walmart de Mexico systematically bribed government officials to obtain permits and other benefits to open new stores in Mexico far more quickly than would have been possible if Walmart had followed Mexican laws. According to the report, Walmart de Mexico may have spent more than $24 million in bribes and then covered up the payments. Further, the report alleges Walmart de Mexico executives knew about the payments and actively took steps to conceal them.
