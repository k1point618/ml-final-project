Reuters reported that Intel Corporation will spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15% of ASML Holding NV. Intel hopes to speed the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. Intel will acquire an initial 10% stake in its European supplier and tack on another 5% if it wins shareholder approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. It also benefits by being able to move on to larger wafer sizes.Â
