Arkansas And Federal Officials Sue Exxon Mobil Corp Over March Pipeline Oil Spill-DJ
Thursday, 13 Jun 2013 12:35pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that Arkansas and federal officials filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corp for allegedly violating pollution laws following the March rupture of an oil pipeline in the state. The suit, filed in federal court in Arkansas, alleges that the March 29 rupture of the Pegasus pipeline near Mayflower, Ark., led to violations of the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act, the state Hazardous Waste Management Act and the federal Clean Water Act. The suit also accuses the Company of operating a storage facility for the recovered oil without a permit. The pipeline ruptured next to a residential subdivision, spilling an estimated 5,000 barrels of Canadian crude through yards and streets into a small creek, wetlands and a nearby recreational lake. Twenty-two homes were evacuated. The alleged state law violations are subject to civil fines ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 per day, while the federal Clean Water Act violations carry fines up to $4,300 per barrel of oil spilled.Â
