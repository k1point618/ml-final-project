U.S. Investigates Whether JPMorgan Chase & Co. Traders Hid Losses-Reuters
Friday, 13 Jul 2012 05:39pm EDT
Reuters reported that U.S. federal investigators are looking at whether JPMorgan Chase & Co. traders hid trading losses that have since grown to $5.8 billion, after the bank said its own probe found reason for suspicion. JPMorgan believes it will lose at most another $1.7 billion from the bad credit trades. Problems at the group that made the bets, the Chief Investment Office (CIO), have been fixed, said Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. CIO traders had used derivatives to bet on corporate debt. Investors cheered the bank for capping losses and taking steps to ensure it avoids similar bad bets in the future.Â
