Verizon Communications Inc, Vodafone Group Plc Mull Verizon Wireless Options-Reuters
Wednesday, 6 Mar 2013 04:19am EST
Reuters reported that Verizon Communications Inc has weighed several options involving its relationship with Vodafone Group Plc and its joint ownership of Verizon Wireless ranging from ending its wireless venture with the European company to a full merger with Vodafone, Bloomberg reported. The U.S. and UK mobile-phone operators discussed a full combination as recently as December, according to Bloomberg. The talks stalled over issues of leadership and location of a new company, making a buyout or partial sale of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless more likely. Verizon Communications holds a 55% stake in Verizon Wireless. Vodafone owns the rest. Vodafone has embarked on a program to sell assets it did not control, aiming to streamline its portfolio and return cash to shareholders who felt the company's share price did not reflect the sum of its many individual assets.Â
