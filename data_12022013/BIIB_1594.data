Biogen Idec Inc and Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc announced that the companies have entered into a broad, multi-year collaboration to leverage antisense technology to advance the treatment of neurological diseases. The agreement combines Biogen Idec's experience in neurology with Isis' leadership in antisense technology to develop novel therapies to treat neurological disorders. This is the fourth collaboration between the two companies in the last two years. Terms of this collaboration include: Biogen Idec will make an upfront payment of $100 million, a majority of which will be reflected as R&D expense in Biogen Idec's third quarter financial results. Isis is eligible to receive payments, license fees and royalty payments for all treatments developed through this collaboration, with the specific amount dependent upon the modality of the molecule advanced by Biogen Idec. In the case of antisense molecules, the payments could be as much as $220 million, plus additional amounts related to the cost of clinical trials conducted by Isis under the collaboration.Â
