Hagens Berman Files Lawsuit Against Ford Motor Co Alleging MyFord Touch System Defective
Monday, 15 Jul 2013 08:50pm EDT
Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, a national consumer-protection law firm, announced that it has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging that Ford Motor Co's MyFord Touch, MyLincoln Touch and MyMercury Touch touchscreen systems are defective, often freezing, failing to respond to voice and touch commands and failing to connect to mobile phones. The 41-page complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for Central California, includes a long litany of problems with the system, and details Ford`s failed attempts at correcting the system through system updates and other fixes. The systems, introduced by Ford in 2011, promised owners of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles with the ability to seamlessly operate audio controls, use a GPS navigation system, control climate systems and operate a Bluetooth-enabled device through the system. According to the suit, the system fails even while controlling crucial vehicle functions, such as the defroster and rear-view camera, which are controlled through the system, putting drivers and passengers at risk. The complaint also calls out consumer complaints involving the vehicles` GPS navigation system. According to the complaint, the touchscreen will turn off, turn back on with a message saying it is "performing scheduled maintenance" leaving the driver without any directional guidance.Â
