Thursday, 3 Oct 2013 07:10am EDT
Reuters reported that Italy's financial police have seized EUR15 million ($20.4 million) from Bank of America Merrill Lynch as part of a probe into alleged fraud involving derivative contracts with the city of Verona, the police said on October 3, 2013. The seizure, which took place at the bank's Milan headquarters, was ordered by Verona prosecutors, a police spokesman said. The seizure is linked to allegations of hidden commissions in the underwriting of derivative contracts dating back to 2007, a source at the tax police in Verona told Reuters.Â
