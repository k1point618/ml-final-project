Thursday, 17 Jan 2013 01:47am EST
Dow Jones reported that Softbank Corp would sell shares in recently purchased wireless carrier eAccess Limited to 11 different parties such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Nokia Oyj and Ericsson, making the company an equity-method affiliate. The Japanese firm said it decided to transfer a part of its shares in eAccess in order for the company to maintain a certain degree of independence. Softbank did not disclose the amount or proportions of the stakes that each company would obtain. Softbank said the share transfer won't have a material impact on the firm's group earnings results for the current fiscal year ending in March, adding that it predicts its operating income for the year will exceed Y700 billion.Â
