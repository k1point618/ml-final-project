British Court To Hold Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch Intern Inquest On November 22-Reuters
Monday, 7 Oct 2013 09:04am EDT
Reuters reported that a British court said it will conduct an inquest into the death of 21-year-old Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern Moritz Erhardt after a post-mortem examination that showed he died of epilepsy. The inquest at the London coroner's court is set for November 22 and is expected to last about an hour. Erhardt was in the last few days of a seven-week internship at the U.S. bank's investment banking division when he was found dead in his London lodgings on August 15. His death raised serious concerns about interns working long hours and even through the night, after reports suggested Erhardt had worked for 72 hours without sleep before he died. Bank of America said in August it was reviewing the working conditions for junior employees. Legal inquiries into the medical cause and circumstances of deaths, or inquests, are conducted when the cause of death is still uncertain after a post-mortem or when a death was violent or unnatural, or occurred in prison or police custody.Â
