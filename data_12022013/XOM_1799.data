Middle East North Africa Financial Network Inc. reported that NK Lukoil OAO's Overseas Chief, Mr. Andrei Kuzyaev, announced that NK Lukoil OAO withdrew its bid to buy a 60% stake in Iraq's West Qurna-1 oil field from Exxon Mobil Corp.Kuzyaev said that NK Lukoil OAO evaluated all the risks and concluded that since it's already operating the West Qurna-2 project efficiently without a partner, then it would be a great risk for NK Lukoil OAO to run another project, although the project is still attractive in terms of investment.Â
