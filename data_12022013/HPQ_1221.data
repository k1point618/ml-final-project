Attorney Jahan C. Sagafi of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP , and Adam T. Klein of Outten & Golden LLP announced the filing of a class action lawsuit charging that Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) has a common practice of misclassifying its technical support workers as exempt and failing to pay them for all overtime hours worked in violation of federal overtime pay laws. HP employs several thousand technical support workers nationwide. Many of these employees worked at smaller companies, such as Autonomy, Palm, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), 3Com, ArcSight, and 3PAR, that have recently been acquired by HP.Â
