Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB and Biogen Idec Inc Initiate Global Clinical Trials of Long-Lasting Hemophilia A and B Product Candidates in Children
Thursday, 5 Jul 2012 02:30am EDT
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB announced that together with Biogen Idec Inc (Biogen) it has initiated two global pediatric clinical trials of the companies' long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX Fc fusion proteins (rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc) in hemophilia A and B. rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc are fully-recombinant clotting factors developed using Biogen's monomeric Fc-fusion technology, which makes use of a natural mechanism to recycle rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc in the circulation in the body. The companies are to study this technology to see whether it extends half-life and enables the proteins to last longer in the body than commercially-available factor products. The clinical trials are open-label, multicenter studies designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc in previously-treated children with severe hemophilia A or B under the age of 12 years. The first patient has been dosed in the rFIXFc pediatric study, and the rFVIIIFc pediatric study is actively recruiting patients. Global registration studies of rFVIIIFc and rFIXFc are ongoing in previously-treated patients with severe hemophilia A or B aged 12 years and over, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2012.Â
