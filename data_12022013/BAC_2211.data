Bank of America Corp Reaches Settlement in Merrill Lynch Acquisition-Related Class Action Litigation
Friday, 28 Sep 2012 08:30am EDT
Bank of America Corp announced that it and certain of its current and former officers and directors, have agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought in 2009 on behalf of investors who purchased or held Bank of America securities at the time the Company announced plans to acquire Merrill Lynch. Under terms of the proposed settlement, Bank of America would pay a total of $2.43 billion and institute certain corporate governance policies. Plaintiffs had alleged, among other claims, that Bank of America and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements about the financial health of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Bank of America denies the allegations and is entering into this settlement to eliminate the uncertainties, burden and expense of further protracted litigation.Â
