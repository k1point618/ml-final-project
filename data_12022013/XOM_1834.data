OMV Petrom SA and Exxon Mobil Corp’s ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania Limited Announces Domino-1 Well Progress Update
Friday, 3 Feb 2012 09:52am EST
OMV Petrom SA together with ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Romania Limited (EMEPRL), an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp, announced that natural gas has been encountered in Domino-1, a deepwater exploration well in the Romanian sector of the Black Sea. This is encouraging, but it is too early in the data evaluation and exploration process to speculate on whether it will prove to be commercial or not. The Domino-1 well is located in the Neptun Block, 170 kilometers offshore in water about 1,000 meters deep. Drilling operations started at year-end 2011 and are ongoing. The total depth of the well is expected to be more than 3,000 meters below sea level.
