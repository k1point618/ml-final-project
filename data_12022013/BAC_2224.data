Julius Baer Gruppe AG To Acquire Merrill Lynch's International Wealth Management Business Outside United States From Bank of America Corporation
Monday, 13 Aug 2012 01:00am EDT
Julius Baer Gruppe AG announced that it has agreed to acquire Merrill Lynch's International Wealth Management business (IWM) based outside the US with USD84 (CHF81) billion of assets under management (AuM) as of June 30, 2012, and over 2,000 employees, including more than 500 financial advisers. As part of the transaction, Julius Baer and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) have agreed to enter into a cooperation agreement whereby BofAML will provide certain products and services to Julius Baer, including global equity research. In addition there will be cross-referral of clients between both organisations. The agreed transaction price is 1.2% on AuM transferred (payable as and when AuM transfer to Julius Baer). Therefore, assuming CHF72 billion AuM transferred, Julius Baer's existing AuM as of 30 June 2012 would increase by approx. 40% to CHF251 billion on a pro forma basis and its total client assets to CHF341 billion.Â
