EU Clears Angolan LNG JV By BP Plc, Chevron Corp, Eni SpA, Sonangol, Total SA-DJ
Wednesday, 16 May 2012 05:27am EDT
Dow Jones reported that the European Commission approved the proposed acquisition of the Angolan company Angola LNG by BP Plc, Chevron Corp, Eni SpA, Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola (Sonangol) of Angola and Total SA. The joint venture (JV) will produce liquefied natural gas in Angola, to be sold on to customers around the world for re-gasification. The Commission said the move didn't raise competition concerns because of the joint venture's moderate anticipated market share.Â
