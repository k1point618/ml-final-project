Google Inc To Cut 1,200 Jobs At Motorola Mobility-Reuters
Friday, 8 Mar 2013 01:23am EST
Reuters reported that Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit will slash 1,200 jobs or 10% of its workforce as the smartphone maker tries to return to profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported. The layoffs come on top of 4,000 jobs Google eliminated at Motorola Mobility in August as the Internet search giant seeks to make more smartphones and fewer simple handsets. Google and Motorola Mobility could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular business hours.Â
