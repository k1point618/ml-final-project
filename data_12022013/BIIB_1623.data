Tuesday, 24 Apr 2012 07:32am EDT
Biogen Idec Inc announced that detailed positive data from CONFIRM, the second Phase 3 clinical trial of oral BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), will be presented in three platform presentations at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in New Orleans. In CONFIRM, BG-12 demonstrated efficacy across a variety of clinical and radiological outcome measures, as well as favorable safety and tolerability profiles. These data, along with results from BG-12’s first Phase 3 study, DEFINE, were included in regulatory applications that were submitted to U.S. and EU regulatory agencies early this year.
