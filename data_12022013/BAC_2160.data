Reuters reported that Bank of America Corp has agreed to pay $32 million to settle charges that it made harassing debt collection calls to customers' cell phones, in what is believed to be the largest cash payout ever under a 1991 law meant to protect consumers from unwanted calls. The settlement will resolve multiple proposed class action lawsuits filed on behalf of 7.7 million of the bank's credit card and mortgage loan customers, according to court documents.Â
