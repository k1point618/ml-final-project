Bank of America Corporation Wins Class Action Status-Reuters
Monday, 6 Feb 2012 07:01pm EST
Reuters reported that Bank of America Corporation won class-action status for their lawsuit accusing the bank of fraudulently misleading them about the 2008 takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co and the size of Merrill's losses and bonus payouts. U.S. District Judge on February 6, 2012 rejected the U.S. bank's argument that the investors could not prove they suffered losses by relying on materially misleading statements or omissions. Among the other defendants who were also sued and opposed class certification were former Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, former Merrill Chief Executive John Thain, former Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price, and Bank of America's board of directors.Â
