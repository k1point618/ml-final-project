Thomas H. Lee Partners Eyes Buyout Of Yahoo! Inc.'s US Business-Reuters

Monday, 28 Nov 2011 09:40pm EST

Reuters reported that Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL) is interested in buying the U.S. operations of Yahoo! Inc., breaking away from other bidders that are for now eyeing either a minority stake or teaming up with the Company's partners in Asia. THL is hoping to do a leveraged buyout of Yahoo's U.S. business, which could be worth $5 billion to $6 billion and draw on its experience running other media assets such as Nielsen Co, Clear Channel and Univision to turn around the ailing company. In taking this approach, THL is charting a different path than other private equity firms such as Silver Lake, KKR and TPG, which are expected to put in bids for a stake of up to 20% in the company on Monday.Â
