Apple Inc Says Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Patent Royalty Demands Unfair- Reuters

Wednesday, 25 Jul 2012 08:00pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is demanding from the iPhone maker a far higher patent royalty than Apple pays to other companies, at a rate the South Korean company has never sought from any other licensee. The information was contained in portions of an Apple legal brief freshly unsealed in U.S. court on July 25, 2012, and provides more detail about each side's negotiating position in the run-up to a high stakes trial set to begin next week. In a separate filing, Samsung contended that its royalty demands are consistent with industry norms. Also on July 25, 2012, a U.S. magistrate in San Jose, California, ruled that Samsung wrongly let employees delete emails that could have helped Apple pursue its $2.53 billion lawsuit over disputed patents. The magistrate, Judge Paul Grewal, also said that a jury may hold this matter against the South Korean company. A trial is scheduled to start in the San Jose federal court July 30, 2012.Â
