Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Files Class Action Suit Against Facebook, Inc

Wednesday, 23 May 2012 09:30am EDT

Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Facebook, Inc. common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s May 18, 2012 initial public offering. The complaint charges Facebook and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Act of 1933. On or about May 16, 2012, Facebook filed with the SEC a Form S-1/A Registration Statement for the IPO. On or about May 18, 2012, the Prospectus, which forms part of the Registration Statement, became effective and defendants sold 421 million shares of Facebook common stock to the public at $38 per share, for total proceeds of more than $16 billion. The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO were false and misleading in violation of the Securities Act. The complaint asserts that defendants failed to disclose that because Facebook was experiencing a pronounced reduction in revenue growth due to an increase of users of its Facebook app or website through mobile devices rather than traditional PCs, at the time of the IPO the Company had told the lead underwriters to reduce their 2012 performance estimates for Facebook.
