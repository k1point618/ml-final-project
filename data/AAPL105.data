Apple Inc Fails To Fend Off Mobile Tracking Lawsuit; Federal Judge Dismisses Google Inc And Several Other Defendants From Lawsuit-Reuters

Wednesday, 13 Jun 2012 01:45pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc must defend against a lawsuit accusing it of letting advertisers secretly track the activity of millions of mobile device users, a federal judge ruled, but Google Inc and several other defendants were dismissed from the case. Owners of iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches may pursue claims against Apple under two California consumer protection laws, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. Koh oversees nationwide litigation combining 19 lawsuits. But the judge threw out claims that Apple violated customers' privacy rights, and also threw out claims under federal laws addressing computer fraud, wiretaps, and records disclosure. Other defendants dismissed from the case include AdMarval Inc, Admob Inc, Flurry Inc and Medialets Inc.Â
