US ITC To Review Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Patent Decision-Reuters

Monday, 19 Nov 2012 06:10pm EST

Reuters reported that The U.S. International Trade Commission will review a judge's decision which found that Apple Inc did not violate patents owned by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in making the iPod touch, iPhone and iPad. An administrative law judge at the ITC had said in a preliminary ruling in September that Apple was innocent of violating the patents. The ITC, which could have opted to simply uphold the judge's decision, said that it would take up the matter. A final decision is expected in January. If Apple is found to infringe, its devices can be banned for sale in the United States.Â
