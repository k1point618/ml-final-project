Microsoft Corp Wins Ruling Against Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility Over Texting-Reuters

Thursday, 24 May 2012 01:51pm EDT

Reuters reported that a German regional court ruled in a hearing on Thursday that Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility infringed Microsoft Corp patents by offering the option on its mobile phones to send a longer text in a batch of several messages. The two companies are fighting each other in courts across the globe, as are several other makers of devices including Apple , over the intellectual property of software features offered in the latest smart phones and gadgets. In another case, the same regional court in the city of Munich on Thursday rejected a complaint by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility's use of a software feature called programme localisation. Motorola Mobility, in turn, is currently suing Microsoft in the U.S. over features in the Xbox gaming consoleÂ
