Facebook Inc Executives Get Judge To Toss Four IPO-Related Lawsuits-Reuters

Wednesday, 13 Feb 2013 04:46pm EST

Reuters reported that Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other executives won the dismissal on February 13, 2013 of four shareholder lawsuits following the social networking company's $16 billion Initial Public Offering (IPO) last year. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan concluded that the individual investors who brought the cases could not establish standing to sue because they were not Facebook shareholders at the time the alleged wrongdoing took place. The cases largely center on allegations that Facebook executives failed to make adequate disclosures ahead of the IPO about weakened revenue growth projections resulting from greater use of the company's website through mobile devices. Fifty-three lawsuits have been consolidated before Sweet stemming from the IPO.Â
