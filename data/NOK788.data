Nokia Oyj Proposes Share Repurchases

Thursday, 24 Jan 2013 06:29am EST

Nokia Oyj announced that the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board to resolve to repurchase a maximum of 370 million Nokia shares. The proposed amount of shares represents less than 10% of all the shares of the Company. The shares may be repurchased in order to develop the capital structure of the Company, finance or carry out acquisitions or other arrangements, settle the Company's equity-based incentive plans, be transferred for other purposes, or be cancelled. The shares may be repurchased either through a tender offer made to all shareholders on equal terms, or in marketplaces by repurchasing the shares in another proportion than that of the current shareholders. The authorization would be effective until June 30, 2014 and terminate the current authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2012. The repurchase authorization is proposed in order to maintain flexibility, but the Board has no current plans for repurchases during 2013.Â
