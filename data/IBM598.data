International Business Machines Corp announced that Tonkin Consulting, a national engineering, environmental and spatial consulting practice, will replace its existing HP switching hardware and servers with IBM PureFlex. Tonkin Consulting selected IBM to be the core component of its new enterprise-wide IT strategy to address its future needs and growth strategy because the PureFlex System integrates the server, storage, networking and software into a highly automated, simple-to-manage system. Working with Business Partner Vintek, IBM provided Tonkin Consulting with a PureFlex solution that includes integrated v7000 storage as well as additional IBM system networking, system x and tape storage products. The deal was signed in October and the implementation of the new system will be completed in December.Â
