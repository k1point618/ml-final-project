Apple Inc To Settle Lawsuit On App Purchases By Kids-Reuters

Tuesday, 26 Feb 2013 02:22am EST

Reuters reported that Apple Inc has agreed to settle a class action lawsuit that said customers were charged when their children inadvertently downloaded certain applications from the Company's online store. Under the proposed settlement, Apple could potentially end up paying around $100 million as it has agreed to provide a $5 iTunes store credit to as many as 23 million affected customers, the court filing said. The final settlement figure may vary. Also, those claiming $30 or more from Apple may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an iTunes store credit, according to the filing. The lawsuit, filed by five parents in 2011, involved allegations surrounding purchases in certain downloaded apps, which plaintiffs claim were made by children without the knowledge or permission of the account holder.Â
