Wednesday, 3 Jul 2013 07:34pm EDT

Dow Jones reported that Google Inc has taken a small stake in music-video service Vevo as part of a deal to keep its content on Google's YouTube video site, the search giant said. Google's roughly 7% investment values the four-year-old Vevo at around $650 million, meaning Google put in around $45 million of its own money, said a person familiar with the deal.Â
