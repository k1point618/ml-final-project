Apple Inc Wows Market With Record $17 Billion Bond Deal-Reuters

Tuesday, 30 Apr 2013 03:03pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc wowed the debt markets on April 30, 2013, with the largest non-bank bond deal in history, offering a whopping $17 billion for sale as the U.S. computer giant switches strategy to placate restless shareholders. Just a week after announcing its first drop in quarterly earnings in a decade, Apple came to market with the massive deal to raise funds for an ambitious program that will return $100 billion in cash to holders of Apple shares. Sources said investors could barely submit orders fast enough to get in on the deal from Apple, the only major tech company without a single penny of debt on its books. The six-part all-dollar offering attracted more than $50 billion of orders by midday in New York - a massive level of demand even in the current red-hot climate of the bond markets.Â
