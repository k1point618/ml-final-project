Wal-Mart Stores Inc Stops Selling Amazon.com's Kindles-Reuters

Thursday, 20 Sep 2012 03:32pm EDT

Reuters reported that Wal-Mart Stores Inc will no longer sell Amazon.com's Kindle eReaders and tablets, severing its relationship with a major competitor and placing a bet that consumers are more interested in Apple's iPad and other gadgets. The retailer, which has been trying to catch up to Amazon in online sales, said the decision was consistent with its overall merchandising strategy. Owners of Kindle tablets such as the new Kindle Fire HD can shop on the devices for millions of items beyond digital books.Â
