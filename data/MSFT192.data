Microsoft Corp, Google Inc's Motorola Millions Apart On Royalty Payment Case-Reuters

Monday, 17 Dec 2012 09:50pm EST

Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp and Google Inc's Motorola phone unit remain millions of dollars apart in their respective valuations of video and wi-fi patents at issue in a pivotal case before a federal judge in Seattle. The outcome, expected sometime next year, could be a key development in the balance of power between Microsoft and Google, and the rest of the technology industry, in the running battle over ownership of the technology underlying increasingly popular smartphones, tablets and game consoles. A trial, held November 13-20 in the Western District of Washington federal court, was designed to settle the matter of how much Microsoft must pay Motorola for use of two of its standard, essential patents used in its Xbox game console and other products. In redacted post-trial filings made public on Monday - essentially its final arguments before the judge - Microsoft argued that it should pay no more than $502,000 per year for Motorola's H.264 video compression patent, and no more than $736,000 per year for Motorola's 802.11 wi-fi technology. Motorola - acquired by Google earlier this year, partly for its valuable patent portfolio - submitted a far larger valuation.Â
