King & Nix and Morgan & Morgan File Class Action Suit Against Facebook Inc And Underwriters Of Company's Initial Public Offering

Tuesday, 19 Jun 2012 02:56pm EDT

Former Alabama Attorney General Troy King's law firm, King & Nix, announced that it has joined forces with Morgan & Morgan in filing a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Facebook Inc (Facebook) who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of common stock pursuant to or traceable to the Company's May 18, 2012 initial public offering (IPO). The Complaint alleges that the Registration Statement issued in connection with the IPO was materially false and misleading in violation of the federal securities laws. More particularly, the complaint notes that Facebook failed to disclose to the investing public the material information that the Company was experiencing, and anticipating, a significant drop in revenue due to an increase of users accessing Facebook through mobile devices. According to news reports, this lower revenue projection was selectively released by underwriter banks to only certain clients and not included in the Registration Statement. Facebook's May 18, 2012, IPO raised over $16 billion by selling over 420 million shares of the Company's common stock to investors at a price of $38.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, certain Defendants filed a Registration Statement with several amendments and a Prospectus.Â
