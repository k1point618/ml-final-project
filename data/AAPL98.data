US Judge Sets 2013 Trial Date For Apple Inc e-book Lawsuit-Reuters

Friday, 22 Jun 2012 08:13pm EDT

Reuters reported that a U.S. judge on Friday set a 2013 trial date for a lawsuit from the U.S. government accusing Apple Inc and book publishers of conspiring to fix the prices of electronic books. Following a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said a bench trial in the case will begin June 3, 2013, for Apple and two publishers who are fighting the antitrust charges. The U.S. Justice Department sued Apple in April, saying it colluding with five publishers to boost e-book prices in early 2010, as the Silicon Valley giant was launching its popular iPad tablet. Apple argues it has not conspired with anyone or fixed prices for e-books in an effort to thwart Amazon's dominance of that fast-growing market.Â
