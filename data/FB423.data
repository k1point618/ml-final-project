The Securities Arbitration Law Firm of Klayman & Toskes Launches Investigation On Behalf Of Facebook Inc Investors Who Sustained Losses as a Result of Execution Errors In Their Fidelity Accounts

Thursday, 24 May 2012 11:58pm EDT

The Securities Arbitration Law Firm of Klayman & Toskes, P.A. (K&T) announced that it is investigating potential claims on behalf of Facebook, Inc., investors who sustained losses in their Fidelity Investments accounts as a result of execution problems at the brokerage firm. It has been reported that "thousands" of Fidelity’s clients have been affected by trading issues which arose following the initial public offering of Facebook. Specifically, many of these investors have learned that their orders for Facebook stock were not executed at the prices they previously expected. Similarly, some investors decided to cancel their orders of Facebook stock before it began trading at 11:30 a.m. on May 18, but the stock was assigned to their Fidelity accounts anyway. Due to Fidelity’s failure to honor the order cancellation, some investors were faced with unexpected margin calls which only exasperated the situation.
