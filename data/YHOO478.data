Blackstone Group L.P., Bain Eye $25 Billion Yahoo! Inc. Deal-Reuters

Wednesday, 30 Nov 2011 10:16pm EST

Reuters reported that Blackstone Group L.P. and Bain Capital are preparing a bid for all of Yahoo! Inc. with Asian partners in a deal that could value the company at about $25 billion. The potential bid by the consortium, which would include China's Alibaba.com Limited and Japan's SOFTBANK CORP., has not yet been finalized. Alibaba, whose primary interest is in buying back a 40% stake owned by Yahoo, is keeping its options open and said it has not decided whether to participate in a bid for all of Yahoo. A bid for Yahoo at more than $20 per share would mean a deal value of about $25 billion based on 1.24 billion shares outstanding, potentially making it the largest leveraged buyout in recent years.Â
