China Tech Company Sues Apple Inc For Patent Infringement-DJ

Thursday, 5 Jul 2012 08:47am EDT

Dow Jones reported that Shanghai Zhi Zhen Internet Technology has filed a suit against Apple Inc. (AAPL) for patent infringement in a Shanghai court. A spokesman for the company said it had filed a suit in June against Apple for infringing on a patent it holds for its Xiao i Robot, a Chinese language, automated-voice system similar to Siri. Earlier this month Apple said it would unroll Mandarin and Cantonese speaking Siri software for the China and Hong Kong markets. He added the purpose of the suit was to stop Apple from infringing on its technology and force the valuable company to bear the cost of litigation. The spokesman said it applied for a patent for its voice software in 2004.Â
