Ryan & Maniskas, LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Facebook Inc

Friday, 25 May 2012 07:16pm EDT

Ryan & Maniskas, LLP announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Facebook Inc. common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s May 18, 2012 initial public offering (the IPO). The complaint charges Facebook and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). On or about May 16, 2012, Facebook filed with the SEC a Form S-1/A Registration Statement for the IPO. On or about May 18, 2012, the Prospectus, which forms part of the Registration Statement for total proceeds of more than $16 billion. The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the IPO were false and misleading in violation of the Securities Act. The complaint asserts that defendants failed to disclose that because Facebook was experiencing a pronounced reduction in revenue growth due to an increase of users of its Facebook app or website through mobile devices rather than traditional PCs, at the time of the IPO the Company had told the lead underwriters to reduce their 2012 performance estimates for Facebook. These revisions were material information which was not shared with all investors, but rather, was selectively disclosed by defendants to certain preferred investors and omitted from the Registration Statement and/or Prospectus.
