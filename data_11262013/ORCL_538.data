Monday, 2 Apr 2012 03:14pm EDT
Reuters reported that Oracle Corporation and Google Inc. property lawsuit and the companies' lawyers should prepare for trial, a U.S. magistrate judge ruled on Monday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal said he would not convene any further settlement conferences in the patent and copyright lawsuit against Google over the Java programming language. The trial is currently scheduled to begin on April 16 before U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco. Oracle sued Google in 2010, alleging the company's Android mobile operating technology infringes Oracle's Java patents.Â
