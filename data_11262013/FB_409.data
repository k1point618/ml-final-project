Facebook Inc To Buy Facial Recognition Startup-Reuters

Monday, 18 Jun 2012 02:26am EDT

Reuters reported that Facebook Inc is buying Face.com, the company that now provides facial-recognition technology used by the social network to help users identify and tag photos. The deal bolsters one of Facebook's features the sharing and handling of photos but the use of the startup's technology has spurred concerns about user privacy. Neither Facebook nor Face.com disclosed terms of the deal, which is expected to close in coming weeks. Media reports in past weeks have pegged the size of the transaction at between $80 million to $100 million.Â
