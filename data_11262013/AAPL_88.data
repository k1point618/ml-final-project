Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Wins Bid To Sell Nexus In Apple Inc Court Battle-Reuters

Saturday, 7 Jul 2012 07:09pm EDT

Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd scored a partial victory against Apple Inc, after a U.S. appeals court lifted a freeze on sales of its Galaxy Nexus smartphones but upheld a lower court’s decision to temporarily halt sales of its Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer. Apple accused its Asian rival Samsung in lawsuits of blatantly copying its iPhones and iPads. Last week, a San Jose court granted rare, temporary injunctions against the sale of the Galaxy mobile devices in question, a triumph for the Silicon Valley consumer electronics giant that had asked for the bans until their trial begins July 30, 2012.
