Google Inc Sues BT Group PLC For Patent Infringement-Reuters
Wednesday, 13 Feb 2013 06:05pm EST
Reuters reported that Google Inc and its Motorola Mobility unit struck back on February 13, 2013 against BT Group Plc, filing patent lawsuits against the British telecommunications group more than a year after BT launched its own lawsuit against Google. BT, Britain's dominant fixed-line telecoms group, sued Google in 2011 over six patents related to mobile technology. But in a lawsuit filed on February 13, 2013 in a California federal court, Google asserted four patents of its own. Google spokeswoman Niki Fenwick said the company also filed a separate lawsuit against BT in a U.K. court. A BT representative said the company does not comment on pending litigation.Â
