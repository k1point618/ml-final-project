EU Says Google Inc Must Change Search Results Presentation-Reuters

Thursday, 10 Jan 2013 03:51pm EST

Reuters reported that Google Inc will be forced to change the way its search results are presented in Europe or face antitrust charges for 'diverting traffic' to its own services, The Financial Times reported. The EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, told the newspaper in an interview published on Friday that he intends to prevent Google from allegedly distorting choices for consumers and taking business from rivals. Google has been the center of a two-year investigation by the EU based on complaints that Google unfairly favored its services over its rivals in search results and that it may have copied material from travel and restaurant websites without permission.Â
