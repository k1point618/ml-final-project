Reuters reported that Yahoo Japan Corporation's talks with key shareholder Yahoo! Inc. for a share buyback have ended with no agreement, but the companies left open the possibility of further negotiations. Yahoo Inc, under pressure to free up cash for shareholders and simplify its ownership structure, has been looking for more than a year to monetise its stake in Yahoo Japan, which was formed as a joint venture with Japan's Softbank Corp in 1996.Â
