Amazon.com's Amazon Publishing Acquires Avalon Books
Monday, 4 Jun 2012 04:15pm EDT
Amazon.com and Avalon Books announced that Amazon Publishing has acquired the publication rights from Avalon Books to over 3,000 backlist titles predominantly in the Romance, Mystery and Western categories. Established in 1950 by Thomas Bouregy, Avalon Books has long been a home to writers specializing in wholesome entertainment across genres, such as Holly Jacobs, Carolyn Hughey and Carolyn Brown, whose book The Ladies` Room is nominated for a 2012 RITA by the Romance Writers of America. Avalon books will be published under the West Coast imprints of Amazon Publishing, including Montlake Romance and Thomas & Mercer. These books will continue to be available in print for booksellers and libraries nationwide. Ms. Mickelsen will be assisting for several months to support a smooth transition for authors and to help secure eBook amendments for some of the older Avalon titles whose digital rights are not owned by Avalon, with the intention of bringing these books to a wider audience. Avalon Books was advised on the transaction by Bill Barry who acted as exclusive broker on its behalf. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Â
