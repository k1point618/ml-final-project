Apple Inc Versus Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Patent Trial Kicks Off In Australia-Reuters

Monday, 23 Jul 2012 04:14am EDT

While any decision in the Australian case is unlikely to have a substantial impact in other jurisdictions like Europe or the United States where the technology giants are suing each other, lawyers say the trial proceedings could reshape the legal strategies employed by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in other countries.Â
