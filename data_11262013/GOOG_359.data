Google Inc.'s Google Ad Business Faces Antitrust Inquiry in India-The Wall Street Journal Online
Monday, 7 May 2012 01:42am EDT
The Wall Street Journal Online reported that India has launched an antitrust probe of Google Inc.'s online advertising business to investigate potential anticompetitive practices, government officials familiar with the matter say, marking the latest setback for the Internet company in an emerging market where it has lofty ambitions. The probe, which could take several months to complete, is initially focused on AdWords, Google's flagship advertising product and main source of revenue. But the agency conducting the investigation, the Competition Commission of India, could expand it to scrutinize other Google services if it sees fit, according to the Indian officials. It wasn't immediately clear why the commission is investigating AdWords, through which Google sells sponsored-links on its search service. A spokesman for Google said the company hasn't been notified of the antitrust investigation and therefore isn't in position to comment on it.Â
