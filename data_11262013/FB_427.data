Bernstein Liebhard LLP Files Securities Class Action Against Facebook, Inc

Wednesday, 23 May 2012 12:40pm EDT

Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced that a securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of a class of purchasers of Facebook, Inc. securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with its $16 billion initial public offering of common stock on May 18, 2012 . The action was brought against Facebook, certain of its officers and directors, and the underwriters of the IPO for violations of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint alleges that the IPO Registration Statement and Prospectus were negligently prepared and failed to disclose material information about Facebook's business, operations and prospects. On May 22, 2012, reports surfaced that analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Facebook's IPO, had revised downward their financial forecasts for the Company during the IPO roadshow. The revised forecasts were reportedly only passed along to certain investors who were then able to sell their Facebook shares for a profit while the stock price rose immediately following the IPO. On May 22, 2012, Facebook shares closed at $31.00, significantly lower than the IPO price of $38.00. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have announced plans to investigate issues relating to the Facebook IPO.Â
