Google Inc. Fined $25,000 For Impeding FCC Investigation-Reuters

Reuters reported that Google Inc. has been fined $25,000 for impeding a U.S. investigation into the Company's data collection for its Street View project, which allows users to see street level images when they map a location. The Federal Communications Commission imposed the fine late on Friday, saying Google had collected personal information without permission and had then deliberately not cooperated with the FCC's investigation. Between May 2007 and May 2010, Google collected data from wi-fi networks throughout the United States and across the world as part of its Street View project, which gives users of Google Map and Google Earth the ability to view street-level images of structures and land adjacent to roads and highways. But Google also collected passwords, Internet usage history and other sensitive personal data that was not needed for its location database project.Â
