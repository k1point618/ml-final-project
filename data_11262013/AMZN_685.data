Research Frontiers Inc announced that it has filed a lawsuit against E Ink Corporation; E Ink Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Prime View International Co., Ltd.); Amazon.com Inc.; Sony Electronics Inc.; Sony Corporation; Barnes & Noble Inc; and Barnesandnoble.com LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for patent infringement.

In this lawsuit, Research Frontiers asserts infringement by the named defendants of United States Patent No. 6,606,185, entitled SPD Films and Light Valves Comprising Liquid Suspensions of Heat-Reflective Particles of Mixed Metal Oxides and Methods of Making Such Particles, and United States Patent No. 5,463,491, entitled Light Valve Employing a Film Comprising an Encapsulated Liquid Suspension, and Method of Making Such Film. Research Frontiers alleges that E Ink's products and those of its customers such as various models of the Amazon Kindle, Sony Reader, Barnes & Noble Nook, and other e-reader/e-book devices, infringe on its patents. Research Frontiers has retained the law firm of Niro, Haller & Niro, a Chicago-based law firm that specializes in intellectual property litigation, to prosecute the case.Â
