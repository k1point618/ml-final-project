Thursday, 3 Oct 2013 06:03pm EDT
Reuters reported that Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison has agreed to give up a potential payout of around $500 million to settle accusations of a conflict of interest in the 2011 acquisition by Oracle of a company he controlled, according to court documents. The settlement relates to Oracle's purchase of Pillar Data Systems Inc, a data storage company that was majority owned by Ellison. Under the deal, Ellison, who co-founded Oracle and owns around a quarter of its stock, would have received the first $562 million of any payment related to the acquisition, according to the court filing. According to the settlement, whatever the payment ultimately is, Ellison must pay 95% of it to Oracle.Â
