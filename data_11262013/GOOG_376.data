Google Inc. Gets US, EU Nod To Buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc-Reuters

Monday, 13 Feb 2012 06:38pm EST

Reuters reported that U.S. and European regulators approved Google Inc's $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc, and said they would keep a sharp eye on the web search giant to ensure patents critical to the telecom industry would be licensed at fair prices. Google said in August that it would buy phone-maker Motorola for its 17,000 patents and 7,500 patent applications. Regulators in China, Taiwan and Israel have still not signed off on the Google purchase of Motorola.Â
