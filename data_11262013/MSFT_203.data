STMicroelectronics NV Starts Production of Motion and Orientation Sensor Solutions for Windows 8-Based Tablets from Microsoft Corp

Friday, 26 Oct 2012 09:00am EDT

STMicroelectronics NV announced that it has collaborated with Microsoft Corp. to develop a motion and orientation Human Interface Device (HID) sensor solution for the Windows 8 operating system. STMicroelectronics NV's MEMS sensors and the sensor-hub solution are ready to ship in high volumes with the release of Windows 8. STMicroelectronics NV's sensor hub combines a 3-axis digital gyroscope, a 3-axis digital accelerometer, and a 3-axis digital magnetometer with a proximity sensor, a barometric pressure sensor, and a high-performance STM32 microcontroller that runs ST`s iNEMO Engine sensor-fusion algorithms and HID using the Inter-Integrated Circuit(I2C) protocol.Â
