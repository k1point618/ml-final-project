Nokia Oyj (Nokia) announced an agreement with a United States (US) cafe chain, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, to offer wireless charging facilities in its cafes for customers who want to recharge their phones whilst on the go. Bringing charging solutions from the home and office to the high street, Nokia will introduce integrated wireless charging plates into The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf cafes in select metropolitan cities across the US. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is a privately-held specialty coffee and tea retailer in the US, with more than 850 stores in 24 countries. It is also present in 40 airport locations, such as Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Changi Airport in Singapore and New Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport. This follows the launch of two new Nokia Windows Phone 8 devices which both offer wireless charging. The Nokia Lumia 920 features in-built wireless charging, while the new Nokia Lumia 820 benefits from wireless charging via a removable and exchangeable shell. In addition, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf will launch a new mobile app for Nokia Lumia and Windows Phone smartphones. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf application will include features such as social media feeds, store locator, store amenities and contact information. Additional features include seasonal beverage selections, gifts, charitable initiatives and others.Â
