US Regulators Probe Google Inc. Privacy Breach-Reuters
Friday, 16 Mar 2012 10:07pm EDT
Reuters reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is examining whether Google Inc. deceived consumers by planting so-called Internet cookies in Apple's Web browser without users' consent, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The agency is investigating whether the cookies allowed it to aim advertising at users of Apple's Safari browser, and also whether Google violated other rules involving consumers' consent. A Google representative responded in an email to Reuters that the company created a temporary communication link from Safari with Google’s servers that helped ascertain whether Safari users were also signed into Google and had opted for personalized ads and other content.
