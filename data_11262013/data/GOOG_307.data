Immersion Corp announced that it entered into a settlement and license agreement with Google Inc and Motorola Mobility LLC, resolving the patent infringement litigation brought by Immersion against Motorola. The litigation was initiated based on Motorola`s various uses of a simple form of haptic effects in its mobile devices, sometimes referred to as Basic Haptics. Under the settlement and license agreement, Immersion is receiving compensation for prior shipments of Motorola devices containing Basic Haptics technology, the parties have agreed to a license relating to future shipments of Motorola devices with Basic Haptics, and have resolved certain issues with respect to Google-branded smartphones containing Basic Haptics. The agreement does not extend to other manufacturers` handsets that use the Android operating system. As a result of the settlement, Immersion will dismiss all pending litigation between it and Motorola.Â
