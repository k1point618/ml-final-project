Sunday, 26 May 2013 05:51pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that according to The Financial Times report the European Union is investigating whether Apple Inc. has been using its sales tactics and technical restrictions on the smart-phone in an attempt to squeeze competitors from the market. Several EU mobile network operators were sent questionnaires from the EU last week, which told participants the European Commission is looking at distribution terms that might aid Apple by seeing to it rivals are unable to secure better sales deals, the FT said. The inquiry is still in the preliminary stages, the FT said. Prior to launching a formal investigation, the commission must determine that Apple is dominant in the EU smartphone market.Â
