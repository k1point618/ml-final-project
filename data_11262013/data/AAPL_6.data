ITC Delays Ruling On Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Import Ban In Apple Inc Case-DJ
Thursday, 1 Aug 2013 06:33pm EDT
Dow Jones reported that the International Trade Commission said it will delay its final ruling on whether products from Samsung Electronics Co. infringed Apple Inc.'s patents and should be barred from import into the U.S. as a result. In a statement, the commission said it now plans to issue its ruling on August 9. It had been expected on August 01, 2013. In October last year, a judge from the commission issued an initial ruling saying Samsung had infringed four of Apple's patents, including those covering the design of the iPhone and technology both for touch-screen devices and for connecting headphones. The judge said that Samsung had not infringed some other Apple patents, including one for a part of the iPhone's designs. The ruling delay comes as the Obama administration weighs whether to veto the ruling on a different case concerning the same two companies. The ITC had concluded that various Apple products, including the AT&T Inc. (T) versions of the iPhone 4 and iPad 2, infringed Samsung's patents and should be blocked from being imported or sold in the U.S. The ruling was seen as a blow to Apple's legal efforts against its competitors, Samsung in particular, which have seen mixed results. Apple sued Samsung in a California court two years ago, claiming the company's smartphones infringed its designs.Â
