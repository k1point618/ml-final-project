Friday, 25 May 2012 03:33pm EDT
Pomerantz Haudek Grossman & Gross LLP announced that it has filed a federal securities class action in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on behalf of all persons who purchased securities of Facebook Inc. pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the Company's May 18, 2012 initial public offering. This class action is brought under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 15 U.S.C. Sections 77k, 77l and 77o. On May 17, 2012, the Company announced the pricing of its IPO of 421,233,615 shares of its common stock at $38.00 per share. The total offering price was priced at over $16 billion, with underwriters' discounts and commissions totaling over $176 million, shares sold by the selling shareholders totaling over $9 billion, and shares sold by the Company totaling $6.8 billion. In connection with the Company's IPO, Defendants failed to disclose that: the Company was then experiencing a severe and pronounced reduction in revenue growth due to an increase of users of its Facebook app or website through mobile devices rather than a personal computer such that the Company told the Underwriter Defendants to materially lower their revenue forecasts for 2012; During the IPO roadshow conducted in connection with the IPO, the underwriters, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, reduced their second quarter and full year 2012 earnings forecasts for Facebook.Â
