Dow Jones reported that Yahoo! Inc. has applied to be removed from a lawsuit lodged in an Indian court against social networking sites hosting allegedly offensive content. More than 20 Internet companies, including Google Inc. and Facebook, have been named in the case, which follows meetings between government ministers and the companies over material seen as offending Muslims or defaming politicians. Yahoo! was made part of the lawsuit on the patently mistaken assumption that it is a social networking website.Â
