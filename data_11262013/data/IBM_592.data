Thursday, 7 Feb 2013 11:15am EST
International Business Machines Corp announced it has completed the acquisition of StoredIQ, a privately held company based in Austin, Texas. Adding StoredIQ to IBM's big data offerings gives organizations tools for more effective governance of the vast majority of information, including its timely disposal to eliminate unnecessary data that consumes infrastructure and elevates risk. The addition of StoredIQ builds on IBM's prior acquisitions of PSS Systems and Vivisimo as well as organic solutions that improve information economics including value-based archiving, records and retention management, ediscovery management, and disposal and data governance. StoredIQ software provides scalable in-place analysis and management of disparate and distributed email, file shares, desktops and collaboration sites.Â
