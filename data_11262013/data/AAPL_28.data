Apple Inc To Lose iPhone Trademark In Brazil-Reuters
Tuesday, 5 Feb 2013 04:21pm EST
Reuters reported that Brazil's copyright regulator will strip Apple Inc of the right to use its iPhone trademark in Latin America’s biggest market and granted the trademark to a local company that registered it first. The Brazilian Institute of Intellectual Property will officially announce its decision on February 13, 2013. Apple could then challenge the ruling in the Brazilian courts. A spokesperson with Apple in Brazil declined to comment.
