U.S. Judge Orders Apple Inc To Disclose To Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Details Of Patent Settlement With HTC Corp-DJ

Dow Jones reported that a U.S. judge Wednesday ordered Apple Inc to disclose to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd details of its patent settlement with HTC Corp, a move that could help the Korean company build its case to fight a potential sales ban in the U.S. According to court documents filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Samsung is seeking 'discovery', a legal term used for when both parties must disclose and exchange evidence to one another, of the settlement agreement to support its opposition to Apple's permanent injunction motion. Samsung believes that a royalty is a more suitable alternative to a permanent injunction, the filing said. Earlier this month, Apple and HTC signed a broad 10-year licensing agreement that settles all of their lawsuits between the companies around the world. Apple first sued HTC in 2010. Samsung and Apple are still fighting it out in global courts accusing one another of patent infringement. In the U.S. case, a federal jury awarded Apple damages of more than $1 billion, but Samsung has vowed to fight the decision. A hearing has been set for December 6, during which a judge will look into Apple's request to ban several Samsung products in the U.S.Â
