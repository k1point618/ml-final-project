Reuters reported that Research In Motion, Ltd. is considering splitting its business in two, separating its struggling handset manufacturing division from its messaging network, The Sunday Times reported. The Company, which last month said it had hired JP Morgan and RBC Capital to look at its strategic options, could break off its handset division into a separate listed company or sell it. Potential buyers would include Amazon.com and Facebook Inc, adding that the Company's messaging network could also be sold, or opened up to such as Apple Inc. and Google Inc. to generate income. An alternative option would be to keep the company together but sell a stake to a larger technology firm such as Microsoft.Â
