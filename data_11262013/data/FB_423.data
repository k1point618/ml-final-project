Hagens Berman Files Securities Class Action against Facebook, Zuckerberg and Underwriters: Continues Insider Trading Investigation Against Selling Shareholders
Friday, 25 May 2012 09:45am EDT
Hagens Berman announced that it has filed a securities class-action lawsuit against Facebook, Inc., officers, directors and underwriters of the Company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on behalf of investors relating to allegations of whisper estimates withheld from all but a few select investors. The complaint, filed May 24, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, as Chang et al. v. Facebook, Inc. et al., case number 12-cv-2680, alleges that Facebook, Inc., Mark Zuckerberg, David A. Ebersman, David M.Spillane, Marc L. Andreesen, Erskine Bowles, James W. Breyer, Donald E Graham, Reed Hastings, Peter Thiel, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Peirce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc. violated Section 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. Hagens Berman's lawsuit alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws by omitting material information in their registration statement and prospectus, and by selectively disclosing this material information to their clients and preferred investors prior to the IPO. Facebook allegedly privately pre-announced that its second quarter would fall short of analysts' estimates. Facebook allegedly only told their underwriters analysts and directed them to change their estimates which were then verbally conveyed to preferred clients.Â
