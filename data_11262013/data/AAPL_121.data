Apple Inc Rejects E-book Pricing Collusion Charge-Reuters
Thursday, 12 Apr 2012 11:11pm EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc has rejected the U.S. Justice Department's allegations that it colluded with publishers over electronic book pricing, calling the charges simply not true, the Wall Street Journal reported. The launch of the iBookstore in 2010 fostered innovation and competition, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry, Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris told the Journal. The U.S. government had sued Apple and five publishers, saying they conspired to fix the prices of electronic books, and reached a settlement with three of the publishers that could lead to cheaper e-books for consumers. Kerris defended the current pricing structure as parallel to Apple's mobile software store. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.Â
