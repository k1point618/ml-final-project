U.S. Court Clears Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Phone, Hands Apple Inc. Setback-Reuters
Thursday, 11 Oct 2012 04:41pm EDT
Reuters reported that a U.S. appeals court overturned a pretrial sales ban against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy Nexus smartphone, dealing a setback to Apple Inc. in its battle against Google Inc's increasingly popular mobile software. Apple is waging war on several fronts against Google, whose Android software powers many of Samsung's devices. The ruling on Thursday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is not expected to have an outsized impact on the smartphone market, as the Nexus is an aging product in Samsung's lineup.Â
