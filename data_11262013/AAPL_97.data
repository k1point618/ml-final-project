Judge Halts Sales Of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Tab in U.S., Against Apple Inc's Request-Reuters

Wednesday, 27 Jun 2012 02:00am EDT

Reuters reported that a U.S. judge on Tuesday backed Apple Inc's request to stop Samsung Electronics Co Ltd selling its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet in the United States, giving the iPhone maker a significant win in the global smartphone and tablet patent wars. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, had previously denied Apple's bid for an injunction on the tablet and multiple Galaxy smartphones. However, a federal appeals court instructed Koh to reconsider Apple's request on the tablet.Â
