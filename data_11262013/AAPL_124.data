DOJ May Sue Apple Inc. Over ebooks-Reuters

Tuesday, 10 Apr 2012 07:38pm EDT

Reuters reported that the Justice Department (DOJ) could sue Apple Inc. as early as Wednesday over alleged electronic book price-fixing, while settling with several publishers as early as this week. The Justice Department is investigating alleged price-fixing by Apple and five major publishers, CBS Corporation's Simon & Schuster Inc, HarperCollins Publishers Inc, Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group, Pearson PLC and Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH. A lawsuit against Apple, one of the parties not in negotiations with the Justice Department for a potential settlement, could come as early as Wednesday but no final decision has been made.Â
