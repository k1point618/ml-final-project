Stamell & Schager, LLP Initiate Class Action Lawsuit Against Facebook Inc

Friday, 1 Jun 2012 07:14pm EDT

Stamell & Schager, LLP announced that it has filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook Inc, its officers and underwriters in federal court in the Southern District of New York (No. 12-cv-4332) on behalf of all persons who purchased Facebook common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's May 18, 2012 initial public offering (the IPO). The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to publicly disclose that Facebook realized that it would suffer a severe and pronounced reduction in revenue growth in the current year due to an increase of users of its Facebook mobile application or website through mobile devices rather than through traditional personal computers. The reduction was so pronounced that the Company told the Underwriter Defendants to materially lower their revenue forecasts for 2012. In addition, that Facebook failed to disclose in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that, during the roadshow conducted in connection with the IPO, certain of the Underwriter Defendants reduced their second quarter and full year 2012 performance estimates for Facebook. These reductions were material information which was selectively disclosed by defendants to certain preferred investors, but was omitted from the Registration Statement and the ProspectusÂ
