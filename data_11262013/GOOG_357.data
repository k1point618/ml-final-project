Iran Threatens To Sue Google Inc. Over Dropping Persian Gulf-Reuters

Thursday, 17 May 2012 03:54pm EDT

Reuters reported that Iran's Foreign Ministry threatened on Thursday to take legal action against Google Inc. for dropping the name Persian Gulf from its Google Maps and leaving the waterway between Iran and Arab states nameless, state television reported. Designation of the key waterway for global oil and gas supplies has long been a touchy issue among the countries bordering it - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iraq and Iran. Iran says it is the Persian Gulf, the Arab states say it is the Arabian Gulf.Â
