Nokia Oyj Launches Nokia Musin in United States

Tuesday, 4 Sep 2012 07:03am EDT

Nokia Oyj announced that it has launched its free music streaming service Nokia Music in the United States. Nokia Music is a free mobile experience exclusive to Nokia Lumia handsets. Consumers can stream music from a suite of over 150 exclusive playlists that are curated and kept up to date by a team of United States-based musicologists. The playlists span a wide spectrum of musical genres from underground Detroit house tracks to New York Philharmonic favorites. Nokia Music also offers playlists created by global artists such as Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga and Rihanna. Beyond the curated playlists, music fans can create their own personal soundtrack by selecting the Nokia Music 'CREATE' function that taps a library of millions of songs and generates a playlist based on, and inspired by, the artists they love. Consumers who already own a Nokia Lumia 900 or Nokia Lumia 710 can download the Nokia Music app for free from Marketplace.Â
