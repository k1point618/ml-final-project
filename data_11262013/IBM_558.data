US Court Rules For Amazon.com Inc In Central Intelligence Agency Cloud Contract Dispute Against International Business Machines Corp-Reuters

Monday, 7 Oct 2013 11:28pm EDT

Reuters reported that a U.S. court ruled in favor of Amazon.com Inc which is locked in a dispute with International Business Machines Corp (IBM) over a $600 million cloud computing contract awarded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a court notice showed. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a unit of online retailer Amazon.com, beat out IBM earlier this year to win the CIA contract. When AWS won, IBM protested, triggering a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which recommended in June that the CIA re-do some parts of its contract negotiations, giving IBM another chance to bid. But the GAO also stated that AWS's offering was superior. Amazon filed a legal complaint against GAO's recommendation that the CIA could give IBM another chance to bid for the contract. On October 07, 2013, oral arguments were held before Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. At the end of the arguments, Wheeler ruled for Amazon and against IBM, which had intervened in the case. A written opinion will follow, according to a court notice.Â
