International Business Machines Corp and 10gen Collaborate to Bring Mobile to Enterprise
Thursday, 6 Jun 2013 07:57pm EDT
International Business Machines Corp and 10gen, the MongoDB company, announced they are collaborating on a new standard that will enable the Global 2000 to more easily embrace mobile computing. Driving this standard will help to unlock all of the data that exists within an enterprise and simplify the creation of next generation mobile and web apps for all platforms. Since its inception, four million developers have downloaded MongoDB, the NoSQL database technology, to design mobile and web apps. By embracing this new standard, the two companies are providing mobile developers with the ability to combine the critical data managed by IBM DB2 systems with the next generation mobile apps that are being designed using MongoDB. Now, organizations will be able to seamlessly create sophisticated apps without having to invest in new skills or tools that they do not possess today. MongoDB adoption is already broad across enterprises of all sizes, according to a number of indices, and by working together the two companies expect that adoption to grow.Â
