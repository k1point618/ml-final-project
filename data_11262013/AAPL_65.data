Apple Inc Triumphs Over Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Awarded Over $1 Billion Damages-Reuters

Friday, 24 Aug 2012 07:37pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc scored a sweeping legal victory over Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Friday as a U.S. jury found the Korean company had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded the U.S. company $1.051 billion in damages. The verdict, which came much sooner than expected could lead to an outright ban on sales of key Samsung products and will likely solidify Apple's dominance of the exploding mobile computing market. Apple's charges that Samsung copied its designs and features are widely viewed as an attack on Google Inc and its Android software, which drives Samsung's devices and has become the most-used mobile software. The jury deliberated for less than three days before delivering the verdict on seven Apple patent claims and five Samsung patent claims, suggesting that the nine-person panel had little difficulty in concluding that Samsung had copied the iPhone and the iPad.Â
