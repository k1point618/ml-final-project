Milberg LLP Reminds Investors Of July 23, 2012 Lead Plaintiff Deadline In Class Action Lawsuits Filed Against Facebook, Inc.
Monday, 9 Jul 2012 03:43pm EDT
Milberg LLP reminds investors that class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Facebook, Inc. common stock pursuant to the Company’s May 18, 2012 initial public offering (the IPO). Actions were also filed in the Northern District of California. The complaints allege that the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued with the IPO were false because the Company omitted its reduction in revenue growth and lowered revenue guidance, which had been disclosed during Facebook’s road show. On May 18, 2012, Facebook’s Prospectus became effective and Facebook sold 421 million shares to the public at $38, for total proceeds of more than $16 billion. Shares of Facebook fell 18% over the following two trading days to close at $31 on May 22, 2012, amid revelations about the lowered guidance.
