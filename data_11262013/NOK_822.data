AT&T Inc To Sell Nokia Oyj's Latest Lumias, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Camera-Reuters
Thursday, 4 Oct 2012 04:21pm EDT
Reuters reported that AT&T Inc will start selling Nokia's two latest Lumia smartphones in November, making it the first carrier to commit to the devices in the United States. Both models, the Lumia 920 and 820 will run on its network starting in November. It also said it would sell a Samsung Electronics Co Ltd camera with a wireless connection. Nokia Oyj's introduction of the latest Lumia's last month was met with disappointment because of a lack of details including carrier partners, launch dates, prices for the smartphones powered by Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system.Â
