Linux Users File EU Complaint Against Microsoft Corp-Reuters
Tuesday, 26 Mar 2013 01:55pm EDT
Reuters reported that a Spanish association representing open-source software users has filed a complaint against Microsoft Corp to the European Commission, in a new challenge to the Windows developer following a hefty fine earlier this month. The 8,000-member Hispalinux, which represents users and developers of the Linux operating system in Spain, said Microsoft had made it difficult for users of computers sold with its Windows 8 platform to switch to Linux and other operating systems. Lawyer and Hispalinux head Jose Maria Lancho said he delivered the complaint to the Madrid office of the European Commission. In its 14-page complaint, Hispalinux said Windows 8 contained an 'obstruction mechanism' called UEFI Secure Boot that controls the start-up of the computer and means users must seek keys from Microsoft to install another operating system.Â
