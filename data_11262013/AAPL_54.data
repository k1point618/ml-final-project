Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Battling Apple Inc Verdict, Cites Foreman's Seagate Lawsuit-Reuters

Tuesday, 2 Oct 2012 08:03pm EDT

Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said a major patent verdict in favor of Apple Inc should be overturned because the jury foreman did not disclose that he once was in litigation with Seagate Technology PLC, a company that counts Samsung as a major investor. Samsung's position, disclosed on October 02, 2012, in an unredacted court filing, confirms a report from Reuters last week on the substance of the Samsung Electronics' argument. The global legal war between Apple and Samsung reached a crucial point in August when a jury in northern California found Samsung had improperly violated patented technology in the iPhone and iPad. They awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages, and U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh could impose permanent sales bans on Samsung products. Samsung filed a motion for a new trial last month, but its allegations of juror misconduct were hidden from public view. Koh rejected Samsung's request to keep that argument under seal, and Samsung on October 02, 2012, filed an unredacted version. During jury selection, Velvin Hogan - who eventually became the foreman - disclosed one lawsuit in which he had been involved, but failed to discuss two others, according to Samsung.Â
