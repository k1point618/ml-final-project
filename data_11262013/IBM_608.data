AT&T Inc and International Business Machines Create Global Cloud Service for Businesses

Tuesday, 9 Oct 2012 12:01am EDT

AT&T Inc and International Business Machines Corp announced a business agreement to deliver a highly secure, 'network-enabled' cloud service that uses private networks rather than the public Internet. The companies are combining AT&T virtual private networking and IBM SmartCloud Enterprise+ cloud capabilities with technology from AT&T Labs to create a new, fast and secure shared cloud service. Targeted to Fortune 1000 companies globally, the service will be offered in early 2013 as a new option for clients who are deploying cloud solutions that demand high levels of security and availability. Many businesses often cite security as a key inhibitor to cloud computing adoption.Â
