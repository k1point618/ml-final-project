Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Apple Inc allowed To Add Products In U.S. Patent Lawsuit-Reuters

Thursday, 15 Nov 2012 09:25pm EST

Reuters reported that a U.S. judge allowed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to pursue claims the iPhone5 infringes its patents on November 15, 2012, while also allowing Apple Inc to add claims that the Samsung Galaxy Note, Galaxy S III and the Jelly Bean operating system violate its patents. The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in San Jose, California, was the latest development in a continuing legal war by Apple against manufacturers like Samsung whose products use Google Inc's Android software. In his ruling on November 15, 2012, Grewal said Samsung acted with reasonable diligence in asking the court to allow it to add the iPhone 5 to the case. Apple Inc did not oppose adding the iPhone5. Nevertheless, Grewal warned Apple to "think twice before opposing similar amendments reflecting other newly released products e.g. the iPad 4 and iPad mini that Samsung may propose in the near future.Â
