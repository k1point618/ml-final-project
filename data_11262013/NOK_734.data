Moody's Affirms Ratings on Nokia Oyj and Changes Outlook to Developing from Negative-Reuters

Thursday, 5 Sep 2013 12:43pm EDT

Reuters reported that Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the B1 corporate family rating (CFR) and B1-PD probability of default rating (PDR) of Nokia Oyj (Nokia) and changed the outlook to developing from negative. The change of outlook on Nokia's rating was driven by Moody's view that the Company's business profile will be improved given that the disposal of Nokia's Devices & Services will eliminate a loss-making business that was facing challenges in returning to positive free cash flow generation.Â
