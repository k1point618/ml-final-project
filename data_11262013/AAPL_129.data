Monday, 12 Mar 2012 06:54pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc. and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. held talks on a cross-licensing deal to settle smartphone patent infringement lawsuits, a move that could have benefited all of the companies that use Google's Android software, according to the European Union. The two companies also discussed the 'scope of any potential settlement' following Motorola's sale to Google during the negotiations held in late 2011. The document, published on Friday, provided details of EU's regulatory review of Google's decision to buy Motorola. Both the companies have sued each other in United States and Germany, among other markets.Â
