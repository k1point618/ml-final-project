Apple Inc. Acquires App-Search Engine Chomp-WSJ

Thursday, 23 Feb 2012 09:06pm EST

The Wall Street Journal Online reported that Apple Inc. said it has acquired app-search engine Chomp, gaining a small team of app specialists and technology designed to ease the pain of finding apps. The price Apple paid couldn't be learned but it likely amounts to small change for the tech behemoth, which is wrestling with how to spend its $100 billion in cash. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond saying that Apple occasionally acquires technology companies and "generally doesn't discuss its purpose or plans." Chomp, founded in 2009, has raised around $2.5 million in funding from BlueRun Ventures, SV Angel and others. It is based in San Francisco. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Â
