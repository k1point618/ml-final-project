Google Inc Settles With The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. And Other Publishers Over Digital Books-Reuters

Thursday, 4 Oct 2012 04:18pm EDT

Reuters reported that Google Inc and a group of publishers have agreed to a settlement over making digital copies of books. Google and the Association of American Publishers (AAP) said on Thursday that U.S. publishers can decide whether they want their books made available through Google or not. Google Books allows users to browse up to 20% of the books in its library and then purchase digital versions through Google Play. Publishers get a percentage of any sale. Google has spent years scanning some 20 million books in partnership with major libraries around the world, including the New York Public Library and Stanford University Libraries. This angered publishers and authors who contended that Google violated copyright laws when it failed to seek their permission. Google was sued in 2005 by the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers for violating copyright laws. In 2008, they reached a settlement in which Google agreed to pay $125 million to people whose copyrighted books had been scanned, and to locate and share revenue with the authors who have yet to come forward. But the Justice Department, and other critics, said the deal was illegal. A federal court agreed, and rejected it. The lawsuit was filed by AAP members The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Pearson PLC's Pearson Education Inc and its sister Penguin Group USA, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and CBS Corporation's Simon & Schuster.Â
