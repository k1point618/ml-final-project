Microsoft Corp. Files EU Complaint Over Google Inc, Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.-Reuters

Wednesday, 22 Feb 2012 03:13pm EST

Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp. has asked EU antitrust regulators to intervene in a patent dispute with Google Inc, and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., as it stepped up its battle against Google. Microsoft complained that Motorola Mobility was charging Microsoft too much for use of its patents in Microsoft products a week after the European Commission, the EU's executive arm and the U.S. Justice Department approved Google's $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola. Google had pledged to license Motorola patents on fair and reasonable terms if the deal were allowed to go ahead in the week before EU approval for the deal, which is still being reviewed by China's regulators. But Microsoft argued that Motorola has refused to make its patents available at anything remotely close to a reasonable price in a blog posted by its deputy general counsel Dave Heiner. As a result Heiner said Microsoft had filed a formal competition law complaint against Motorola Mobility and Google. Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for competition affairs at the EU Commission, said the regulator has received the complaint and will examine it. Neither Motorola nor Google commented on the specific allegations. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said Motorola had not received a copy of the complaint but was committed to vigorously defending its intellectual property. Google dismissed the complaint as "just another example of their attempts to use the regulatory process to attack competitors.Â
