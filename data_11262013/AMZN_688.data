Reuters reported that Workers at internet retailer Amazon.com Inc's German operations are set to hold a third one-day strike on Monday in a dispute over pay and benefits. Trade union Verdi has called on workers at Amazon's logistics centres in Leipzig and Bad Hersfeld to stop working from 0400 GMT. About 600 workers at Amazon's facilities in Bad Hersfeld and around 300 in Leipzig went on strike on May 14 and followed up with one-day stoppages on May 27 in Leipzig and May 29 in Bad Hersfeld. The union is also pressing for higher basic pay and bigger supplements for night shifts.Â
