Wednesday, 14 Nov 2012 09:01pm EST

Microsoft Corp and Telefonica Digital announced a multiyear strategic agreement to create a new Global Video Platform (GVP) for all video entertainment services across Telefonica's Operating Businesses. Based on key Microsoft technologies including the Microsoft Mediaroom platform, the GVP is delivering TV services over both managed (IPTV) and nonmanaged (over the top) networks, at global scale, to a range of consumer devices. The first GVP deployments are taking place in Brazil, Chile and Spain, and Telefonica anticipates extending the deployment of TV services based on the GVP to a number of its other Operating Businesses over the next few years.Â
