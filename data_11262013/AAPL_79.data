Tuesday, 24 Jul 2012 02:49pm EDT
Reuters reported that Apple Inc claims it is entitled to $2.525 billion of damages in its battle against Samsung Electronics Co over patents for technology used in smartphones and tablets, such as the iPhone and iPad. The estimate was revealed in a court filing early on July 24, 2012, six days before the consumer electronics companies are scheduled on July 30, 2012 to begin a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. Apple accused Samsung of infringing its patents by making its Galaxy phone and computer tablets work and look like Apple products.Â
