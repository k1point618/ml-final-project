Apple Inc Loses U.S. Appeals Bid In Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Patent Fight-Reuters
Thursday, 31 Jan 2013 01:22pm EST
Reuters reported that A U.S. appeals court rejected Apple Inc's request to revive its bid for a sales ban on Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy Nexus smartphone, dashing the iPhone maker's attempt to recover crucial leverage in the global patent wars. Apple had asked the full Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to revisit a decision in October by a three-judge panel of the same court. The panel rejected Apple's request to impose a sales ban on Samsung's Nexus smartphone ahead of a trial set for March 2014.Â
