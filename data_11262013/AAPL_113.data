VirnetX Holding Corp Receives Markman Order In Patent Infringement Action Against Cisco Systems, Inc., Apple Inc., NEC And Aastra

Thursday, 26 Apr 2012 09:01am EDT

VirnetX Holding Corp announced that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, issued its patent claim construction, or Markman Order in the ongoing patent infringement action between VirnetX Inc. and Cisco, Apple, NEC and Aastra. In a Markman ruling, a district court hearing a patent infringement case interprets and rules on the scope and meaning of disputed patent claim language regarding the patents in suit. A Markman decision is often a significant factor in the progress and outcome of patent infringement litigation. The litigation, which the Company previously announced it had filed in August 2010, involves certain products that the Company believes infringe six patents owned by VirnetX.Â
