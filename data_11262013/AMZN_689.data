Amazon.com Inc Workers In Germany Stage Strike-AP

Monday, 27 May 2013 07:20am EDT

The Associated Press reported that Amazon.com Inc's German workers are staging a short-term strike in a push for higher wages. The ver.di union said employees in Leipzig are walking off the job in a one-day warning strike. The union is pushing the online retailer to adopt wage agreements similar to those governing retail and mail-order workers, which include Christmas bonuses and extra pay for working nights, Sundays and holidays. The agreements could mean as much as EUR9,000 ($11,700) more annually for Amazon workers.Â
