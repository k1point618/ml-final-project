Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit On Behalf Of Investors Against Facebook Inc And The Underwriters Of The Company’s Initial Public Offering

Tuesday, 22 May 2012 07:50pm EDT

Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP announced it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors who suffered losses in connection with the initial public offering (IPO) of Facebook, Inc. In the IPO, Facebook sold more than 420 million shares of Facebook's common stock to the public at a price of $38.00 per share, of which approximately 180 million shares were sold by Facebook and approximately 240 million shares were sold by existing stockholders. The Complaint, captioned Lazar v. Facebook, Inc., et al., was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of San Mateo, on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased the securities of Facebook pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with Facebook's IPO. The Complaint alleges, among others, that the offering materials provided to potential investors were negligently prepared and failed to disclose material information about Facebook’s business, operations and prospects, in violation of federal securities laws. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Facebook, certain of Facebook's executive officers and directors and underwriters of the IPO failed to disclose that during the IPO roadshow, the lead underwriters, including Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman, Sachs & Co., cut their earnings forecasts and that news of the estimate cut was passed on only to a handful of large investor clients, not to the public.
