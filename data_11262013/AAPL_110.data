Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd CEOs In US Court Talks On Patents-Reuters

Monday, 21 May 2012 02:52pm EDT

Reuters reported that the Chief Executives of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd were summoned for court-directed mediation on Monday over the iPhone maker's claims the Korean firm has 'slavishly' copied some of its products. Apple's Tim Cook and Samsung's Choi Gee-sung were instructed by a federal judge to appear for a two-day mediation to help resolve the bitter patent litigation between the two companies. There was no sign of either CEO at the San Francisco federal courthouse on Monday. The mediation session had been on a magistrate judge's calendar for Monday morning, but the meeting, which is not open to the public - could have been arranged at an undisclosed location, such as a law firm office. The U.S. case, the most closely watched in a global patent war between the two companies involving some 20 cases in 10 countries, is set for trial at the end of July in San Jose, California. Each company denies the other's allegations of patent infringement. Apple, the maker of the iPod, iPad and iPhone, has a complex relationship with Samsung, a conglomerate that makes computer chips, Galaxy smartphones, and televisions.Â
