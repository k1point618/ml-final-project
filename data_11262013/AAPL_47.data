U.S. Judge Tosses Apple Inc. Versus Google Inc Lawsuit Over Patents-Reuters

Monday, 5 Nov 2012 06:17pm EST

Reuters reported that Apple Inc.'s lawsuit against Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit over alleged patent abuse was thrown out on Monday just hours before trial, a setback for the iPhone maker in its efforts to gain leverage in the smartphone patent wars. The two rivals were set to square off in a Madison, Wisconsin federal court over the library of patents Google acquired along with Motorola for $12.5 billion in May. Apple Inc claimed Motorola's licensing practices were unfair. However, late last week District Judge Barbara Crabb questioned whether she had the legal authority to hear Apple's claims, and on Monday she dismissed the case.Â
