Yahoo! Inc. Issues Q2 2012 Guidance In Line With Analysts' Estimates
Tuesday, 17 Apr 2012 04:05pm EDT
Yahoo! Inc. announced that for the second quarter of 2012, it expects revenue ex-TAC to be in the range of $1.03-$1.14 billion. Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12% of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. For markets that have not yet transitioned, revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis, and TAC is recorded as a part of total operating expenses. GAAP revenue for the second quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,170- $1,290 million. Income from operations (EBIT) is expected to be in the range of $115-$195 million. This business outlook excludes any restructuring charges arising from plan to reshape Yahoo! for the future as these amounts are not currently estimable. These costs could have a impact on the business outlook amounts. According to I/B/E/S Estimates, analysts were expecting the Company to report revenue of $1.081 billion and EBIT of $148 million for the second quarter of 2012.Â
