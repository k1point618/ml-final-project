Augme Technologies Inc Provides Patent Litigation Against Yahoo, AOL, Pandora, And Velti.

Thursday, 16 Aug 2012 08:00am EDT

Augme Technologies Inc announced the Company's on-going patent enforcement activities, including its seven federal lawsuits involving four of the Company's issued United States patents. Augme Technologies vs. Yahoo!, Augme vs. Tacoda & AOL, Augme vs. Pandora, Augme vs. Velti, Augme vs. Millennial Media. On August 9, 2012 Hon. Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero granted Yahoo!'s motion for summary judgment. The decision concludes the district court phase of this litigation and involves only United States Patent Nos. 6,594,691 and 7,269,636. The suit had accused specific Yahoo! targeted advertising systems of infringement. The Court found, given the evidence presented, that the accused Yahoo! systems could not be found to infringe under the Court's interpretation of Augme's claims. The Court did not rule on invalidity issues raised by Yahoo!. Augme continues to maintain that Yahoo!'s targeted marketing systems use Augme's patented technology and constitutes an infringement of its patent portfolio that the Company will ultimately resolve through licensing or litigation. The Company is considering an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, the highest patent court, of the summary judgment ruling by U.S. District Court. Augme also is exploring opportunities in conjunction with third party licensing partners to move its licensing program forward.Â
