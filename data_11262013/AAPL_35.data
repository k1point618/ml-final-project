ITC Judge Sides With Apple Inc Against Google Inc's Motorola Mobility On Phone Patent-Reuters

Tuesday, 18 Dec 2012 08:42pm EST

Reuters reported that Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit cannot assert a patent against Apple Inc. which covers a sensor that stops phone users from dialing wrong numbers on touchscreen devices, a U.S. trade judge ruled. In an entry on the U.S. International Trade Commission docket on Tuesday, Administrative Law Judge Thomas Pender ruled the Motorola patent invalid. Apple has been litigating around the world against various manufacturers of phones that operate on Google's Android operating system. Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion this year, partly for its library of telecommunications patents. The ITC, a U.S. trade panel that investigates patent infringement involving imported goods, is a popular venue for patent lawsuits because it can bar the importation of infringing products and because it issues decisions relatively quickly.Â
