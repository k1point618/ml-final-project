Judge Approves U.S. Settlement With Apple Inc And Other Publishers Over e-books-Reuters

Thursday, 6 Sep 2012 07:03pm EDT

Reuters reported that a U.S. judge approved on Thursday a Justice Department settlement with three publishers accused of conspiring with Apple Inc and other publishers to push up the prices of electronic books. The Justice Department had accused Apple and five publishers in April of illegally colluding on prices as part of an effort to fight internet retailer Amazon.com's dominance of e-books. The publishers who agreed to settle are The News Corporation's HarperCollins Publishers Inc, CBS Corporation's Simon & Schuster Inc and Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group. Apple; Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH; and Pearson PLC's Penguin Group have vowed to fight the Justice Department's lawsuit with a trial due to start on June 3 next year. The proposed settlement was unpopular with bookseller Barnes & Noble, Inc. and the American Booksellers Association, which represents independent stores, with both arguing that it would strengthen Amazon's dominance.Â
