Dutch Court Gives Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Rare Victory Over Apple Inc.-DJ

Wednesday, 20 Jun 2012 10:32pm EDT

Dow Jones reported that a Dutch court gave Samsung Electronics Co Ltd its first victory in a global patent dispute with Apple Inc. A court in The Hague ordered Apple to pay damages for infringing a technical communications patent in some of its mobile devices, including the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4 and iPad 1 and 2. Damages will be calculated within the next two months, based on the number of patent-breaching products sold by Apple in the Netherlands over the time period of the infringement deemed by the court to be from Aug. 4, 2010. The court rejected Samsung's claims for damages for a further three technical patents. Apple and Samsung have around 30 patent litigation cases against each other in around 10 countries.Â
