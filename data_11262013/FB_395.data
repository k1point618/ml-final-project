Facebook Inc IPO Lawsuits Against NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. And Various Underwriters To Be Heard In New York-Reuters

Thursday, 4 Oct 2012 08:08pm EDT

Reuters reported that dozens of lawsuits against Facebook Inc, the NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. and various underwriters will be centralized before a federal judge in New York, who must sort through the legal aftermath of Facebook's botched initial public offering. A panel of federal judges on Thursday ordered that cases filed around the United States be transferred to U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan. Facebook had requested the transfer, while some investors sought to keep their cases in California. Investors say they lost money due to technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock market and accuse the company of selectively disclosing unflattering information about its business prospects to Wall Street analysts who then shared it with privileged investors.Â
