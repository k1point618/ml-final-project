Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc End App Store' Lawsuit-Reuters

Tuesday, 9 Jul 2013 08:00pm EDT

Reuters reported that Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have ended their lawsuit over who has the right to use the app store name, clearing the way for both companies to use it. U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California, ordered that the case be dismissed at the companies' request, averting a trial that had been scheduled for August 19. This came after Apple issued to Amazon a covenant not to sue over the online retailer's use of the term, eliminating the need for Amazon to pursue a counterclaim seeking permission. The lawsuit alleging trademark violations and false advertising, Apple accused Amazon of misusing the app store name in connection with the sales of apps for Android devices and the Kindle Fire, a tablet that competes with Apple's iPad. Amazon countered that the term app store had become so generic that using it would not mislead customers.Â
