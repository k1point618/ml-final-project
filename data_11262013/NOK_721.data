Wednesday, 20 Nov 2013 11:03am EST

Reuters reported that workers of Nokia Oyj's Chinese factory protest against what they called unfair treatment following the sale of the Company's mobile phones business to Microsoft Corp. Nokia agreed in September 2013 to sell its devices and services business and license its patents to Microsoft. Workers outside the factory gates said they were battling to change new contracts offering them worse employment terms that they said they had been forced to sign after the September 2013 deal.Â
