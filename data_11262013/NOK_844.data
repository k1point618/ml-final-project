InterDigital Inc Prevails In Appeal of Adverse U.S. International Trade Commission Decision In Dispute With Nokia Oyj

Wednesday, 1 Aug 2012 03:44pm EDT

InterDigital Inc announced that it has prevailed in a key appeal against Nokia Oyj in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal related to the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (Commission) 2009 decision in Investigation No. 337-TA-613 initiated by InterDigital involving Nokia 3G WCDMA handsets and other products. The Federal Circuit held that the Commission had erred in interpreting certain claim terms in InterDigital’s patents. Those erroneous interpretations, which had led to the Commission’s finding of no infringement and therefore no violation as to the two patents that were the subject of the appeal, were reversed. The Federal Circuit adopted InterDigital’s interpretation of the claim terms at issue and remanded the case back to the Commission for further proceedings. In addition, the Federal Circuit rejected Nokia’s argument that InterDigital did not satisfy the domestic industry requirement, which is required to obtain relief from the Commission. By rule, Nokia and the Commission have 45 days to petition for rehearing of the Federal Circuit’s decision and may petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari within 90 days after entry of the judgment or a request for rehearing is denied, whichever is later. After the time period for petitioning for rehearing passes or the Federal Circuit denies any such petition, the Federal Circuit will issue its mandate remanding the case for further proceedings by the Commission.
